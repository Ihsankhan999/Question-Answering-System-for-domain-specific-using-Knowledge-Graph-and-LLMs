Do We Publish Credible Evidence?,,"Dept. of Software Engineering, Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden",28-Sep-23,"Software engineering has moved towards being a more evidence-based discipline. For example, systematic literature studies have become a standard practice in our field. However, to be evidence-based, we, as authors of both primary and systematic literature studies, still need to ensure that we publish credible evidence that researchers and practitioners alike can build upon. The keynote will discuss evidence and illustrate that we need to take action to become more evidence-based and that we are all responsible for improving as authors, reviewers, program chairs and editors. Some of the problems are illustrated generally, and then the findings from analyzing a sample of requirements engineering papers are presented before concluding the presentation.",10.1109/RE57278.2023.00008,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260941,,,IEEE Conferences,,C.

A Paradigm Shift in the Automotive Industry and its Requirements,,"Engineering Efficiency, ETAS - Empowering Tomorrow's Automotive Software, Stuttgard, Germany",28-Sep-23,"The automotive market is currently going through significant transformations. Until recently embedded SW was perceived as 'necessary evil’ - needed for the ECU to function but not providing direct value. This is rapidly changing. Consumers view a vehicle as a smartphone on wheels - in reality it's a data center on wheels. In this era of the Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) the importance of software is growing, allowing the value of a vehicle to increase over time - compared to today where a vehicle looses value as soon as it rolls of the assembly line - due to the ability to update the software in the field and incrementally add capabilities over a life time. These needs lead to new requirements regarding life time maintainability and reusability, changing vehicle E/E architectures, and new collaboration models across software domains, from deeply embedded software over edge software to (cloud) backend systems. In addition to the software itself this paradigm shift is changing requirements against development processes, methods and tools. ETAS started early to adapt to the change. In this talk we will share our experience tackling these changes.",10.1109/RE57278.2023.00009,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260902,,,IEEE Conferences,,R.

User Driven Functionality Deletion for Mobile Apps,,"York University, Toronto, Canada; German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, Saarbrücken, Germany; CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Saarbrucken, Germany; University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada",28-Sep-23,"Evolving software with an increasing number of features is harder to understand and thus harder to use. Software release planning has been concerned with planning these additions. Moreover, software of increasing size takes more effort to be maintained. In the domain of mobile apps, too much functionality can easily impact usability, maintainability, and resource consumption. Hence, it is important to understand the extent to which the law of continuous growth applies to mobile apps. Previous work showed that the deletion of functionality is common and sometimes driven by user reviews. However, it is unknown whether these deletions are visible or important to the app users. In this study, we surveyed 297 mobile app users to understand the significance of functionality deletion for them. Our results showed that for most users, the deletion of features corresponds with negative sentiments and change in usage and even churn. Motivated by these preliminary results, we propose Radiation to input user reviews and recommend if any functionality should be deleted from an app's User Interface (UI). We evaluate Radiation using historical data and surveying developers' opinions. From the analysis of 190,062 reviews from 115 randomly selected apps, we show that Radiation can recommend functionality deletion with an average F-Score of 74% and if sufficiently many negative user reviews suggest so.",10.1109/RE57278.2023.00011,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260783,Mobile apps;Survey;App store mining;Software Release planning;Empirical software engineering,,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Mobile Application Privacy Risk Assessments from User-authored Scenarios,,"School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States; School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States; Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, United States; School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States",28-Sep-23,"Mobile applications (apps) provide users valuable benefits at the risk of exposing users to privacy harms. Improving privacy in mobile apps faces several challenges, in particular, that many apps are developed by low resourced software development teams, such as end-user programmers or in startups. In addition, privacy risks are primarily known to users, which can make it difficult for developers to prioritize privacy for sensitive data. In this paper, we introduce a novel, lightweight method that allows app developers to elicit scenarios and privacy risk scores from users directly using only an app screenshot. The technique relies on named entity recognition (NER) to identify information types in user-authored scenarios, which are then fed in real-time to a privacy risk survey that users complete. The best-performing NER model predicts information types with a weighted average precision of 0.70 and recall of 0.72, after post-processing to remove false positives. The model was trained on a labeled 300-scenario corpus, and evaluated in an end-to-end evaluation using an additional 203 scenarios yielding 2,338 user-provided privacy risk scores. Finally, we discuss how developers can use the risk scores to prioritize, select and apply privacy design strategies in the context of four user-authored scenarios.",10.1109/RE57278.2023.00012,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260916,scenarios;entity extraction;privacy;risk,,IEEE Conferences,,T.

Therefore, sUAS applications must be thoroughly evaluated and tested to ensure their adherence to specified requirements, and safe behavior under real-world conditions, such as poor weather, wireless interference, and satellite failure. However, current simulation environments for autonomous vehicles, including sUAS, provide limited support for validating their behavior in diverse environmental contexts and moreover, lack a test harness to facilitate structured testing based on system-level requirements. We address these shortcomings by eliciting and specifying requirements for an sUAS testing and simulation platform, and developing and deploying it. The constructed platform, DroneReq Validator (DRV), allows sUAS developers to define the operating context, configure multi-sUAS mission requirements, specify safety properties, and deploy their own custom sUAS applications in a high-fidelity 3D environment. The DRV Monitoring system collects runtime data from sUAS and the environment, analyzes compliance with safety properties, and captures violations. We report on two case studies in which we used our platform prior to real-world sUAS deployments, in order to evaluate sUAS mission behavior in various environmental contexts. Furthermore, we conducted a study with developers and found that DRV simplifies the process of specifying requirements-driven test scenarios and analyzing acceptance test results.",10.1109/RE57278.2023.00013,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260819,Safety Assurance;Requirements Specification;Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems;Digital Shadow;Cyber-Physical Systems,,IEEE Conferences,,A.

A Comparative Evaluation of Requirement Template Systems,,"Institute for Software Technology (IST) University of Koblenz, Koblenz, Germany; Institute for Software Technology (IST) University of Koblenz, Koblenz, Germany; Institute for Software Technology (IST) University of Koblenz, Koblenz, Germany",28-Sep-23,"Context: Multiple semi-formal syntax templates for natural language requirements foster to reduce ambiguity while preserving readability. Yet, existing studies on their effectiveness do not allow to systematically investigate quality benefits and compare different notations. Objectives: We strive for a comparative benchmark and evaluation of template systems to support practitioners in selecting template systems and enable researchers to work on pinpoint improvements and domain-specific adaptions. Methods: We conduct a comparative experiment with a control group of free-text requirements and treatment groups of their variants following different templates. We compare effects on metrics systematically derived from quality guidelines. Results: We present a benchmark consisting of a systematically derived metric suite over seven relevant quality categories and a dataset of 1764 requirements, comprising 249 free-text forms from five projects and variants in five template systems. We evaluate effects in comparison to free text. Except for one template system, all have solely positive effects in all categories. Conclusions: The proposed benchmark enables the identification of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different template systems. Results show that templates can generally improve quality compared to free text.

ML-Based Compliance Verification of Data Processing Agreements against GDPR,,"SnT, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; SnT, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; SnT, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg",28-Sep-23,"Most current software systems involve processing personal data, an activity that is regulated in Europe by the general data protection regulation (GDPR) through data processing agreements (DPAs). Developing compliant software requires adhering to DPA-related requirements in GDPR. Verifying the compliance of DPAs entirely manually is however time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose an automation strategy based on machine learning (ML) for checking GDPR compliance in DPAs. Specifically, we create, based on existing work, a comprehensive conceptual model that describes the information types pertinent to DPA compliance. We then develop an automated approach that detects breaches of compliance by predicting the presence of these information types in DPAs. On an evaluation set of 30 real DPAs, our approach detects 483 out of 582 genuine violations while introducing 93 false violations, achieving thereby a precision of 83.9% and recall of 83.0%. We empirically compare our approach against an existing approach which does not employ ML but relies on manually-defined rules. Our results indicate that the two approaches perform on par. Therefore, to select the right solution in a given context, we discuss differentiating factors like the availability of annotated data and legal experts, and adaptation to regulation changes.",10.1109/RE57278.2023.00015,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260912,Requirements Engineering (RE);Regulatory Compliance;The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR);Data Processing Agreement (DPA);Machine Learning (ML);Natural Language Processing (NLP),2,IEEE Conferences,,O.

All Eyes on Traceability: An Interview Study on Industry Practices and Eye Tracking Potential,,"Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universitat Hannover, Hannover, Germany; Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universitat Hannover, Hannover, Germany",28-Sep-23,"The benefits of traceability have widely been discussed in research. However, studies have also shown that traceability practices are still hardly established in industrial settings due to the high manual effort and lack of tool support. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using eye tracking to automatically detect trace links to reduce manual effort and thereby increase practical applicability. We conducted an interview study with 20 practitioners to give an overview of traceability practices in industry and how an eye tracking approach would need to be applied in order to be useful. As there is no one-fits-all solution to traceability, and technical limitations of eye tracking still exist, we collected information on used artifact types, tools and requirements management practices to adjust an approach to actual traceability stakeholders' needs. We report on perspectives from different roles in software projects and give an overview of traced artifacts, current traceability purposes and issues, as well as benefits and doubts concerned with using eye tracking to obtain links automatically.

A key technology for addressing this variability is product line engineering. This approach uses a reference architecture to establish a well-designed set of assets that fit together, the Software Product Line (SPL). One of the limitations of variability models is they do not provide information about the quality of new products or how they achieve stakeholder requirements. Several approaches tackle this issue by integrating variability models with goal models. The main challenge is conciliating the different variability perspectives to make the joint use of both models possible without the loss of information or alterations to the models' semantics. In this work, we present a framework for analysing and optimising SPL products considering stakeholders' requirements that respects the semantics of both models. The framework is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP), a field of mathematical programming. Variability and goal models are formalised as a set of linear constraints and are linked using mapping functions.

However, a common challenge in this domain is the lack of annotated data. In this article, we propose and analyze two zero-shot approaches for NER in the requirements engineering domain. These are found to be particularly effective in situations where labeled data is scarce or non-existent. The first approach is a template-based zero-shot learning mechanism that uses the prompt engineering approach and achieves 93% accuracy according to our experimental results. The second solution takes an orthogonal approach by transforming the entity recognition problem into a question-answering task which results in 98% accuracy.

We demonstrate an approach of using videos as a source of user feedback by analyzing audio and visual text, and metadata (i.e., description/title) from 6276 videos of 20 popular products across various industries. We employed state-of-the-art deep learning transformer-based models, and classified 3097 videos consisting of requirements relevant information. We then clustered relevant videos and found multiple requirements relevant feedback themes for each of the 20 products. This feedback can later be refined into requirements artifacts. We found that product ratings (feature, design, performance), bug reports, and usage tutorial are persistent themes from the videos.

Quantifying Requirements Technical Debt: A Systematic Mapping Study and a Conceptual Model,,"The University of Auckland, New Zealand; The University of Auckland, New Zealand; The University of Auckland, New Zealand; The University of Auckland, New Zealand",28-Sep-23,"Requirements Technical Debt (RTD) is a research area where the Technical Debt (TD) metaphor is used to capture the consequences of sub-optimal decisions made concerning Requirements. Understanding the quantification of RTD is key to its management. To facilitate this understanding, we model the quantification of RTD.

This paper reports on the SMS and the development of our model, the RTD Quantification Model (RTDQM). The key observation from our work is that, although RTD is similar in most aspects to TD in software code, it also has its own components. Requirement artifacts have a feedback loop involving the User to precisely capture User Needs. RTD Interest (i.e., additional costs due to sub-optimal decisions concerning Requirements) can incur during both Requirements Engineering and Implementation activities.

However, limited studies are available about the elicitation of impact-related information from stakeholders, and strategies are particularly needed to elicit possible longterm effects, including negative ones, that go beyond the planned system goals. This paper reports a case study about the impact of digitalisation in remote mountain areas, in the context of a system for ordinary land management and hydro-geological risk control. The elicitation process was based on interviews and workshops. In the initial phase, past and present impacts were identified. In a second phase, future impacts were forecasted through the discussion of two alternative scenarios: a dystopic, technology-intensive one, and a technology-balanced one. The approach was particularly effective in identifying negative impacts. Among them, we highlight the higher stress due to the excess of connectivity, the partial reduction of decision-making abilities, and the risk of marginalisation for certain types of stakeholders. The study posits that before the elicitation of system goals, requirements engineers need to identify the socio-economic impacts of ICT technologies included in the system, as negative effects need to be properly mitigated. Our study contributes to the literature with: a set of impacts specific to the case, which can apply to similar contexts; an effective approach for impact elicitation; and a list of lessons learned from the experience.",10.1109/RE57278.2023.00024,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260785,requirements engineering;requirements elicitation;rural areas;case study,,IEEE Conferences,,A.

If a summary of the high-level requirements from obligations present in SE contracts is available to the requirement analysts in a language that is comprehensible to them, they can use this seed requirements knowledge to ask the right questions to the stakeholders. In this paper, we propose an approach for summarizing the requirements present in obligations in a language comprehensible to requirement analysts.

RClassify: Combining NLP and ML to Classify Rules from Requirements Specifications Documents,,"TCS Research, Tata Consultancy Services, Pune, India; TCS Research, Tata Consultancy Services, Hyderabad, India; TCS Research, Tata Consultancy Services, Pune, India; TCS Research, Tata Consultancy Services, Pune, India; TCS Research, Tata Consultancy Services, Pune, India",28-Sep-23,"Typically, business applications have complex and extensive functionality. Often, rules are scattered throughout the application documentation and code, making it challenging to modify them. Because business rules change more frequently, it is preferable to externalize the rules and move them outside the application. The requirements specification can serve as a valuable source for extracting and classifying rules that can further aid in assigning the rules to the appropriate teams based on their areas of expertise and externalizing the rules in the implementation. We introduce RClassify, which extracts and classifies rules from requirements specifications spread across several NL documents into eight different business rule classes.

There is a need for approaches that help the consortium of participants in this innovation exploration task, i.e. to handle the complexity and provide communication means on a right level of abstraction.

Requirements Classification for Smart Allocation: A Case Study in the Railway Industry,,"RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, Västerås, Sweden; RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, Västerås, Sweden; CNR-ISTI, Pisa, Italy; RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, Västerås, Sweden; Alstom, Västerås, Sweden",28-Sep-23,"Allocation of requirements to different teams is a typical preliminary task in large-scale system development projects. This critical activity is often performed manually and can benefit from automated requirements classification techniques. To date, limited evidence is available about the effectiveness of existing machine learning (ML) approaches for requirements classification in industrial cases. This paper aims to fill this gap by evaluating state-of-the-art language models and ML algorithms for classification in the railway industry. Since the interpretation of the results of ML systems is particularly relevant in the studied context, we also provide an information augmentation approach to complement the output of the ML-based classification. Our results show that the BERT uncased language model with the softmax classifier can allocate the requirements to different teams with a 76% F1 score when considering requirements allocation to the most frequent teams. Information augmentation provides potentially useful indications in 76% of the cases. The results confirm that currently available techniques can be applied to real-world cases, thus enabling the first step for technology transfer of automated requirements classification. The study can be useful to practitioners operating in requirements-centered contexts such as railways, where accurate requirements classification becomes crucial for better allocation of requirements to various teams.",10.1109/RE57278.2023.00028,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260910,requirements classification;requirements allocation;natural language processing;language models,,IEEE Conferences,,S.

These requirements are linguistically ambiguous and written in informal language. Utilizing Structured English for requirements eliminates ambiguity, improves data quality, and supports further automated processing while maintaining readability. The recent development of large language models enables a fully automated translation approach using few-shot learning. To deal with the limited context size of large language models, an improved algorithm, OptKATE, is presented to find an ideal set of requirements for few-shot learning. Structured English can be used as a basis for further formalization. This capability is key in creating an interface between natural language processing and verification, in our case, consistency analysis using the Z3 SMT solver. We implemented a grammar for translating Structured English into TCTL using the MontiCore workbench. Furthermore, since SMT-based methods currently rely on manual precondition satisfaction and do not tackle conflicting preconditions automatically, we propose a scenario generation algorithm that generates potential scenarios using the specification and checks the requirements against them. Through this approach, we can better identify and resolve conflicting preconditions, ultimately improving the consistency of requirements.

In order to aid the development of the system and to adhere to the complex safety regulations and standards in place, engineers are often required to maintain bidirectional and consistent traceability between the produced artifacts. However, such artifacts are rarely maintained in one single tool. Because of that, the cross-tool bidirectional traces have to frequently be manually maintained, which can easily become a very time-consuming or infeasible task. Through interviews and observations at our industry partners in regulated domains, we observed that a number of different strategies are used to deal with this challenge. The use of naming conventions, querying, or URL links is observed in the industry. However, they have their shortcomings and hinder engineers from realizing the full potential that traceability can offer. Knowing the challenges in the industry, we explored existing literature. A range of approaches in the literature aims at dealing with traceability, but often they are context-specific and not easily transferable into practice. Given this gap between the state-of-the-art and industry needs, we performed interviews with our industry partners and analyzed tertiary studies from the literature to obtain a better understanding of what traceability properties are needed to unleash the potential of traces. We identified properties that represent the shared challenges between the related work and the industry requirements: discoverability, type checks, flexibility, navigability, and extensibility.

Requirements Analysis of Variability Constraints in a Configurable Flight Software System,,"Computer Science Department, Iowa State University, Ames, USA; Computer Science Department, Iowa State University, Ames, USA",28-Sep-23,"Variability constraints are an integral part of the requirements for a configurable system. The constraints specified in the requirements on the legal combinations of options define the space of potential valid configurations for the system-to-be. This paper reports on our experience with the variability-related requirements constraints of a flight software framework used by multiple space missions. A challenge that we saw for practitioners using the current framework, now open-sourced, is that the specifications of its variability-related requirements and constraints are dispersed across several documents, rather than being centralized in the software requirements specification. Such dispersion can contribute to misunderstandings of the side-effects of design choices, increased effort for developers, and bugs during operations. Based on our experience, we propose a new software variability model, similar to a product-line feature model, in the flight software framework. We describe the structured technique by which our model is developed, demonstrate its use, and evaluate it on a key service module of the flight software. Results show that our lightweight modeling technique helped find missing and inconsistent variability-related requirements and constraints. More generally, we suggest that a variability modeling technique such as this can be an efficient way for developers to centralize the specification and improve the analysis of dispersed variability-related requirements and constraints in other configurable systems.",10.1109/RE57278.2023.00032,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260720,Requirement analysis;Variability constraints;Variability requirements;Configurable system;Feature model,,IEEE Conferences,,C.

In our experience, many companies still lack awareness of the need for digital transformation or are simply not ready for it. The integration of physical and digital products has led to an increase in complexity for both users and companies, necessitating a holistic design approach to encapsulate this complexity and shape a sustainable digital future. While traditional requirements engineering with solution-neutral requirements has been the norm, it is not sufficient for these new core issues. Digital design, with its emphasis on user centered design, technological possibilities, and a comprehensive understanding of the digital ecosystem, fills this gap in requirements engineering. By incorporating digital design competence in every project, companies can design sustainable digital solutions that integrate seamlessly with the user's needs and the company's goals. In this paper, we propose a new field of competence: Digital Design. Within this field we suggest a new model for Shaping, Exploring, and Implementing innovative digital products.

Furthermore, we analyzed the product backlogs and found that more than half of the backlog items of both systems can be related to at least one of the identified sustainability effects.

ARCADE: A Framework for Integrated Management of Safety Assurance Information,,"Campus de Quixadá Universidade Federal do Ceará, Quixadá, Brazil; Centro de Informática Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil",28-Sep-23,"Assurance Case Development is an emerging approach for demonstrating that a system is safe. An assurance case includes top-level claims for a property of a system (e.g., safety) and a structured argumentation that breaks down claims into supporting evidence. Its production is an effortful activity that relies on project information and its associated traceability. It is challenging for developers to build assurance cases as they have to identify and gather the project information relevant to the argumentation and assess its consistency and completeness. However, regular project information (e.g. requirements, design, rationale) and assurance-related information (e.g. hazard, causes, mitigation strategies) are likely managed separately. In this context, we designed the ARCADE framework to support the integration of assurance information together with regular information inside project management tools, and to perform automated consistency/completeness analysis and generation of assurance cases.

This work seeks to make an incremental step towards this objective for legal contracts by making use of contract templates. Our proposed approach starts with a natural language contract template, together with a manually formalized specification of that template. A contract writer can make customizations to the template, which trigger the automatic formalization of the corresponding customized contract. Our target specification language is Symboleo, which is created specifically for contract verification and monitoring. Starting with a manually formalized template reduces the complexity associated with a fully automated formalization. Typical contract templates use simple fill-in-the-blank parameters, which serve as customizations to formalize in our framing of the problem. Our approach pushes the boundaries of these templates by allowing the contract writer to enter complex natural language customizations, such as prepositional phrases and conditional statements. This work explores what types of natural language patterns can be used in that context by analyzing relevant linguistics and real legal contracts.

The elicitation of these implications, that is, of the ethical requirements behind ML-based systems is a new challenge we must address to avoid societal risks. This is particularly urgent for fairness since this notion lacks a precise and commonly accepted definition, thus hampering its assessment.

Leveraging User Feedback for Requirements Through Trend and Narrative Analysis,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada",28-Sep-23,"With the rapid rise of new mediums and surge of user discussion regarding software products, it is increasingly important to consider these user concerns to fulfill user needs, otherwise users may opt for alternatives. Traditional requirements elicitation approaches relied on interviews and surveys with stakeholders to elicit key and important requirements. Despite the advances from recent studies to leverage the “crowd” via increased involvement of crowd based discussions, we still lack empirical structured guidance and approaches to handle feedback from multiple sources and synthesize the themes that emerge from these sources. As providing feedback becomes more accessible for users, managing the volume of feedback is correspondingly challenging. Since development resources are often limited, organizations need to make trade-offs between different user concerns. Gaining more insights on the themes and the trends of these themes from feedback should help organizations conduct these requirement trade-offs. To better explain the emergent trends of user feedback, I use the concept of narratives from economics to explain the phenomenon of what and when users change in their user discussions. Narrative analysis can help explain the causes of feedback trends, which can support organizations determining the priority and validity of various themes from feedback. In this work, I describe my preliminary findings which indicate the profound role that trends and narratives in user feedback have on user perception and concerns. My work has shown that feedback sources, like social media, can provide an avenue to identify requirements. Finally, I outline my plan towards developing a framework to identify trends and narratives, and a tool to support automated identification of requirements in the form of user stories.",10.1109/RE57278.2023.00060,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260833,user feedback;requirements engineering;social media analysis;user stories,,IEEE Conferences,,Z.

Enhancing Requirements Elicitation through App Stores Mining: Health Monitoring App Case Study,,"EuroMov Digital Health in Motion, Univ Montpellier, IMT Mines Ales, Ales, France",28-Sep-23,"Traditional requirements engineering methods typically involve interviews, observations, and questionnaires administered to stakeholders.

During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many CSE organizations complied with working remotely due to the imposed health restrictions; some continued to work remotely while implementing business processes to facilitate team communication and productivity. In remote CSE organizations, managing NFRs becomes more challenging due to the limitations to team communication. While previous research has identified the factors that lead to a lack of shared understanding of NFRs in CSE, we still have a significant gap in understanding how CSE organizations, particularly in remote work, build a shared understanding of NFRs. We conduct a three-month ethnography-informed case study of a remote CSE organization. Through thematic analysis of our qualitative data from interviews and observations, we identify a number of practices for building a shared understanding of NFRs, such as validating NFRs through feedback. The collaborative workspace the organization uses for remote interaction is Gather, which simulates physical workspaces, and which our findings suggest allows for informal communications instrumental for building shared understanding. In addition, we describe the limitations to building a shared understanding of NFRs in the organization, such as gaps in communication and the limited understanding of customer context.

Automated Detection of Typed Links in Issue Trackers,,"Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",19-Oct-22,"Stakeholders in software projects use issue trackers like JIRA to capture and manage issues, including requirements and bugs. To ease issue navigation and structure project knowledge, stakeholders manually connect issues via links of certain types that reflect different dependencies, such as Epic-, Block-, Duplicate-, or Relate-links. Based on a large dataset of 15 JIRA repositories, we study how well state-of-the-art machine learning models can automatically detect common link types. We found that a pure BERT model trained on titles and descriptions of linked issues significantly outperforms other optimized deep learning models, achieving an encouraging average macro F1-score of 0.64 for detecting 9 popular link types across all repositories (weighted F1-score of 0.73). For the specific Subtask- and Epic-links, the model achieved top F1-scores of 0.89 and 0.97, respectively. Our model does not simply learn the textual similarity of the issues. In general, shorter issue text seems to improve the prediction accuracy with a strong negative correlation of −0.70. We found that Relate-links often get confused with the other links, which suggests that they are likely used as default links in unclear cases.

Automated Question Answering for Improved Understanding of Compliance Requirements: A Multi-Document Study,,"SnT Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Deakin University, Geelong, Australia; SnT Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Deakin University, Geelong, Australia",19-Oct-22,"Software systems are increasingly subject to regulatory compliance. Extracting compliance requirements from regulations is challenging. Ideally, locating compliance-related information in a regulation requires a joint effort from requirements engineers and legal experts, whose availability is limited. However, regulations are typically long documents spanning hundreds of pages, containing legal jargon, applying complicated natural language structures, and including cross-references, thus making their analysis effort-intensive. In this paper, we propose an automated question-answering (QA) approach that assists requirements engineers in finding the legal text passages relevant to compliance requirements. Our approach utilizes large-scale language models fine-tuned for QA, including BERT and three variants. We evaluate our approach on 107 question-answer pairs, manually curated by subject-matter experts, for four different European regulatory documents.

Automatic Terminology Extraction and Ranking for Feature Modeling,,"Alibaba Business School, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China; Alibaba Business School, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China; Alibaba Business School, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, USA; Alibaba Business School, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China",19-Oct-22,"Requirements terminology defines and unifies key specialized and/or technical concepts of the software system, which is significant for understanding the application domain in requirements engineering (RE). However, manual terminology extraction from natural language requirements is laborious and expensive, especially with large scale requirements specifications. In this paper, we aim to employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning (ML) algorithms to automatically extract and rank the requirements terms to support high-level feature modeling. To this end, we propose an automatic framework composed of noun phrase identification technique for requirements terms extraction and TextRank combined with semantic similarity for terms ranking. The final ranked terms are organized as a hierarchy, which can be used to help name elements when performing feature modeling. In the quantitative evaluation, our extraction method performs better than three baseline methods in recall with comparable precision. Moreover, our adapted TextRank algorithm can rank more relevant terms at the top positions in terms of average precision compared with most baselines. An illustrative example on the smart home domain further shows the usefulness of our framework in aiding elements naming during feature modeling.

CADE: The Missing Benchmark in Evaluating Dataset Requirements of AI-enabled Software,,"Department of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL; Department of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL",19-Oct-22,"The inductive nature of artificial neural models makes dataset quality a key factor of their proper functionality. For this reason, multiple research studies proposed metrics to assess the quality of the models’ datasets, such as dataset correctness, completeness, and consistency. However, these studies commonly lack a point of reference against which the proposed quality metrics could be assessed. To this end, this paper proposes a generic process that extracts the necessary knowledge to build a reliable reference point for the purpose of explanation, assessment, and augmentation of the AI-software dataset. This process automatically builds a benchmark specific to the software operational domain, interprets the training and validation datasets of AI-enabled perception software systems, and evaluates the dataset semantic quality and completeness relative to the benchmark. We implemented this process within a framework called Concept Augmentation and Dataset Evaluation (CADE), which leverages a series of novel natural language and image processing techniques to construct a semantic benchmark with respect to the domain specifications. The application of CADE to three commonly-used autonomous driving datasets showed several common weaknesses present in the arbitrarily-collected datasets against the encoded domain specifications, demonstrating dataset divergence from the domain concepts and under-represented variances of the concepts in the data. The qualitative evaluation results showed an average of about 75% relevancy of CADE generated topics.",10.1109/RE54965.2022.00013,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9920039,,1,IEEE Conferences,,H.

Vision Videos can be used for this purpose. They visualize the product vision at an early stage of the project. However, some functional aspects, such as an access code being valid only once, are difficult to visualize. Short texts could be a low-effort solution to complement videos with additional information. Thus, represented visions and requirements could be taken to the next level of clarification. Our question is two-fold: What effects do texts have in vision videos? What are suitable ways to add textual information to vision videos? We conducted an eye tracking study to investigate the effects of adding short texts to vision videos, either below the scene or as text overlays. We evaluated these two methods regarding video comprehension, reading time, cognitive load and subjective preference. Our study shows that texts in vision videos improve vision comprehension and thus support the achievement of one requirements engineering goal. Both methods increase the cognitive load of viewers only by a reasonable margin. No clear-cut preference for a single variant was found.

In particular cases, all the requirements cannot be satisfied at the same time, and the control software of the ADS must make trade-offs among their satisfaction. Usually, the trading-offs in the decision-making process are configurable; different configuration options can affect driving behaviors, satisfying or violating requirements at different degrees. Therefore, it is highly important to know whether a configuration can guarantee a safe drive or not, i.e., whether it leads to requirement violations that exceed the allowable range or not. However, there is currently no approach to systematically assess the safety of ADS configurations from the perspective of requirements violations. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a “Hierarchical Safety Assessment” approach (HSA) that is able to quantitatively analyze the violation severity of safety requirements and distinguish safer ADS configurations based on the requirements violations comparison done in a hierarchical way by following requirements importance. We apply HSA to an industrial ADS under six traffic situations. Evaluation results show that HSA is effective in distinguishing safer configurations and provides useful feedback to ADS engineers to reconfigure the ADS in a better way.",10.1109/RE54965.2022.00015,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9920072,Requirements Violation Analysis;Safety Assessment;Autonomous Driving Systems;Configuration,2,IEEE Conferences,,Y.

These advances, however, can come with great cost to society when they fail to comply with government laws and regulations. While compliance failures do result from technical missteps in design, there is also a wide gap between the technical expertise and culture of legal analysts and software engineers, as well as competing priorities between legal requirements and business objectives. In this perspective paper, we propose changing legal compliance from a corporate oversight activity to a principal design activity, wherein lawyers and software engineers employ enhanced methods and tools tailored to bridge the cultural and knowledge gap and assess legal and business trade-offs. To that end, we describe a new software quality, called Legal Accountability, which can be evaluated alongside other qualities, such as usability, modifiability, performance and testing. Legal Accountability has five properties that lawyers and designers must attend to, including legal traceability, completeness, validity, auditability and continuity.

This limits the understanding of their usefulness, applications and desired future developments. We address this problem by elaborating a reference model relating app review mining techniques to specific software engineering activities. In this paper, we present a unified description of software engineering use cases for mining app reviews and define a reference architecture realizing these use cases through a combination of natural language processing and data mining techniques.

The Implications of ‘Soft’ Requirements,,"Dept of Computer Science, Durham University; School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston University; Dept of Computer Science, Durham University",19-Oct-22,"A new focus for RE is investigated as ‘soft’ requirements which extends non-functional requirements/soft goals with a collection of people-oriented phenomena: values, motivations, emotions, and other socio-political issues that may influence the requirements specification. The convergence of RE with user experience (HCI) and technology acceptance from the information systems literature is reviewed from a temporal perspective: pre-use, through initial to longer-term use. A taxonomy of soft requirements is proposed that extends non-functional requirements and soft-goal concepts to direct attention towards user characteristics and beliefs that may have implications for functional as well as system support requirements, such as training, help, explanation and trust in software. A timeline model of soft and hard (functional) requirements is presented with a focus on customization, adaptation and other soft requirements to, improve product acceptance and persuade users to take appropriate action.

We evaluate multiple characterization methods to determine the ability of each method to create distinct, descriptive characterizations. We further evaluate the amount of requirements relevant characterizations created by each characterization method. We find that unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and full sentences all perform similarly in distinguishing clusters from each other. However, we find that fewer and more expressive characterizations, such as full sentences, contain more requirements relevant information from a feedback cluster compared to more numerous but less expressive unigrams, meaning a sentence will better summarize the important requirement relevant information from a cluster.

To address these challenges, this thesis proposes a privacy risk analysis framework called Protected Heterogeneous IoT Network (PHIN). PHIN has the following two goals. First, it aims at identifying privacy risks from four perspectives: i) magnitude of the inconsistency between an IoT device and its privacy policy, ii) inference risk of PII, iii) non-compliance with multiple privacy regulations, and iv) incompatibility between users’ privacy preferences and the device’s default privacy settings. Second, PHIN provides users with a detailed two-layered privacy risk report associated with installing a new IoT device.

Recently, many researchers are focusing on assuring safe outcomes of ML models. However, not enough attention is paid to evaluating the training data uncertainty before indulging in ML training. Currently, there are no specific guidelines on how to perceive, elicit and specify data requirements and assure the data quality depending on the ML objective and problem domain. To address these gaps, this research provides guidelines for a systematic data requirements engineering and data uncertainty assessment process involving diverse stakeholders. A three-layered framework is proposed that helps to explore the data space and elicit verifiable data requirements. Such requirements can facilitate the evaluation of the collective confidence of the experts in data quality.

Towards a Decision Support Tool to Prescribe Recreation for Older Adults in Social Isolation (RxOSI),,"Digital Transformation and Innovation, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada",19-Oct-22,"Social isolation is the objective lack of social connection. Social isolation in older adults was an issue before the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the issue only got exacerbated during this period. Today, loneliness is a bigger public health problem than obesity, and often isolated older adults are lonely too. Recreation activities offer physical, mental, social and cognitive benefits to older adults, including reduction of social isolation and loneliness. Social prescriptions, which have gained momentum in the United Kingdom and Canada, usually include a diverse range of non-clinical interventions, such as educational classes, arts and culture engagement, peer-run social groups, and nature-based activities. The state-of-the-art literature recommends multiple interventions for social isolation and loneliness; however it falls short of explaining the basis of these recommendations. Decision support tools have been extensively used in clinical medicine and they help standardize the quality of care and improve physician workflow.

Requirement specification documents contain details of product features, process flows, activities, rules, parameters, etc. Intricate knowledge of dependencies between these specification elements is necessary for carrying out the effective evolution of the product over time. Today, Business Analysts (BA) are forced to recourse to keyword-based search across multiple requirement specification documents which is a time-, effort-and intellect-intensive endeavor, and vulnerable to the errors of omission and commission. To overcome these lacunae, we propose DizSpec, an automated approach for digitalizing the requirement specification documents into a model form through automatic extraction of specification model elements and the various dependencies between them. The proposed approach creates a digital thread providing machine-processable traceability from product features to its specification elements. It also provides an easy natural language querying mechanism to generate traceability and impact analysis reports of interest.

A Tool for Transcribing and Annotating Requirements Elicitation Interviews,,"College of Coumputing and Software Engineering, Kennesaw State University, Kennesaw, USA; College of Coumputing and Software Engineering, Kennesaw State University, Kennesaw, USA",19-Oct-22,"Requirements elicitation interviews are the most commonly used technique for requirements elicitation. Through interviewing subject matter experts, facilitating deep discussions, and documenting findings, requirement analysts can uncover the true needs of the system to satisfy stakeholders’ needs. However, during these interviews, the analysts often have to divide their attention to asking the right questions, react appropriately to the stakeholder’s responses, and keep track of the information flow throughout the interview. This is a complicated process, during which analysts could make mistakes and miss important information. For these reasons, it could be useful for them to review their interviews to understand what information has been elicited and what has been missed, what they would need to ask as follow up, and what mistakes they have done during the process. To support these processes, we propose AnnoteREI, a tool that allows analysts to upload the recording of their interviews and create an editable transcript with speaker diarization. The tool offers many functionalities for different purposes: (1) students and novices can use it to identify and tag their mistakes, thus improving their skills by learning from their experience; (2) analysts can annotate any part of the transcript and tag it for later review. For example, they can label a section as a requirement or as a topic that requires more investigation, or a name mentioned by the interviewee as another stakeholder; and (3) researchers can use the tagging system to analyze and collect new data.",10.1109/RE54965.2022.00031,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9920036,Requirement Elicitation;Requirement Elicitation Interview;Tool based analysis;Requirements elicitation education;Interview review,1,IEEE Conferences,,S.

A User-friendly Semi-automatic iStar Modeling Approach,,Beijing University of Technology; Beijing University of Technology,19-Oct-22,"iStar modeling is beneficial in the early stage of requirements engineering, helping requirements analysts to analyze requirements and improve the efficiency and quality of the software development procedure. However, it is time-consuming and hard to learn to perform the iStar modeling manually, which can be more practical if the modeling process is automated.To facilitate the distribution of iStar practices, we designed a user-friendly semi-automatic iStar modeling approach to assist users in iStar modeling by extracting model elements from natural language requirement artifacts. Specifically, based on the analysis of the actual modeling process via interviewing, this work proposed an iStar modeling process, and automated three modeling steps: the actor entity extraction, the actor relation extraction, and the intention entity extraction. Then, this work proposes a hybrid method for natural language processing to extract the model elements in requirement sentences to automate the modeling steps. This hybrid method consists of two parts: the deep learning-based method and the logical reasoning method, which utilizes both methods simultaneously, ensuring the high accuracy of the results. Overall, this work proposed a user-friendly semi-automatic approach for aiding the iStar modeling, which proposes an iStar modeling process and automates many steps with hybrid natural language method during the process. We evaluated our proposed approach, and the results show that our proposed approach is efficient and helpful.",10.1109/RE54965.2022.00033,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9920059,,,IEEE Conferences,,Q.

BiStar: A Template-Based iStar Modeling Tool Combining Graphical and Textual Modeling,,"Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China; Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China; Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China",19-Oct-22,"iStar modeling is an effective measure for requirements analysis, and researchers have proposed nearly thirty different modeling tools for this purpose. There are two types of existing modeling tools, i.e., graphical and textual. However, either type has its limitations. Graphical modeling tools suffer from the scalability issue. Textual tools rely on visual models when modeling. To overcome the limitations, we have developed the BiStar, a template-based iStar modeling tool combining graphical and textual modeling. The two main features of our BiStar tool are as follows. First, BiStar adopts textual templates to support the batch addition of four common iStar model elements, including Actors, Intentions, Dependencies, and Refinements. Second, BiStar supports the templated creation of iStar models using text models. In addition, BiStar has full support for graphical iStar modeling as a basic feature of a modeling tool. BiStar automatically visualizes the model elements and templates added in the text as described above. After visualization, modelers can freely choose between graphical and textual modeling to continue modeling. Our BiStar tool thus combines graphical modeling with textual modeling.",10.1109/RE54965.2022.00034,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9920047,iStar;textual modeling;automatic visualization;batch addition;model template,,IEEE Conferences,,H.

Software vendors increasingly rely on user feedback to collect product issues and feature requests, discover requirements and monitor the overall sentiment of the users about a product. While the analysis of user feedback for requirements elicitation has revealed that feedback can contain helpful information for the product team, collecting valuable, informative, and actionable feedback is still challenging: User feedback is often vague, emotional, or missing important information, such as contextual information, to actually support a product team.

Done is better than perfect: Iterative Adaptation via Multi-grained Requirement Relaxation,,"Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan; Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan",19-Oct-22,"In the studies of self-adaptive systems (SAS), requirement relaxation is a widely discussed approach for managing the system’s requirements when dealing with the runtime environment changes (e.g., ignoring low-priority requirements to guarantee high-priority requirements). Guaranteeable requirement analysis (GRA) is recently proposed to determine the relaxation by checking the feasibility of all requirement combinations, enabling the SAS to realize the relaxation autonomously. However, a critical problem of GRA is the trade-off between analysis/relaxation precision and computation time at different granularity levels of requirements. Specifically, the analysis may not be precise enough if the requirements are coarse-grained (i.e., high granularity level), while the analysis may take a too long time if the requirements are fine-grained (i.e., low granularity level). This paper proposed a method, namely iterative adaptation via multi-grained requirement relaxation, to achieve the advantages of high precision and short computation time. Specifically, the SAS first deploys a rapid (but imprecise) relaxation using high granularity-level requirements. It then repeatedly iterates to a preciser (but slower) relaxation with a progressive decrease in the granularity level. An experiment based on the warehouse robot system demonstrates the validity of our proposal.",10.1109/RE54965.2022.00043,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9920063,requirement relaxation;requirement granularity;discrete controller synthesis;self-adaptive system;RE@runtime,4,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Requirements Engineering for Safety-Critical Molecular Programs,,"Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA",19-Oct-22,"The field of cyber-molecular systems is growing rapidly.

Non-functional Requirements for Machine Learning: Understanding Current Use and Challenges in Industry,,"Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, Sweden; Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, Sweden",18-Nov-21,"Machine Learning (ML) is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses big data to produce complex predictions and decision-making systems, which would be challenging to obtain otherwise. To ensure the success of ML-enabled systems, it is essential to be aware of certain qualities of ML solutions (performance, transparency, fairness), known from a Requirement Engineering (RE) perspective as non-functional requirements (NFRs). However, when systems involve ML, NFRs for traditional software may not apply in the same ways; some NFRs may become more prominent or less important; NFRs may be defined over the ML model, data, or the entire system; and NFRs for ML may be measured differently. In this work, we aim to understand the state-of-the-art and challenges of dealing with NFRs for ML in industry. We interviewed ten engineering practitioners working with NFRs and ML. We find examples of (1) the identification and measurement of NFRs for ML, (2) identification of more and less important NFRs for ML, and (3) the challenges associated with NFRs and ML in the industry.

As contextual elements such as time, location, weather, user activity, device characteristics, network status, and countless others are becoming increasingly more accessible, the potential for adding context awareness to applications is enormous. Identifying novel, unexpected, and even delightful context-aware functionalities in practice can be challenging, though: What context information is relevant for a given user task? How can contextual elements be combined? What if there is a large number of contextual elements? Context modeling has been described in the literature as an essential aspect in the elicitation of context-aware functionalities; however, reports on the state of the practice are rare. In this study, we conducted a survey with industrial practitioners, mostly experienced professionals from large enterprises, to investigate how context models and context-modeling activities have been used to support the elicitation of context-aware functionalities. The results indicate a gap between research and industry: Context models are rarely used in practice, and context-modeling activities such as analysis of relevance and especially analysis of combinations of contextual elements have been overlooked due to their high complexity, despite practitioners recognizing their importance.",10.1109/RE51729.2021.00011,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604642,context awareness;requirements engineering;context modeling;survey,2,IEEE Conferences,,R.

Perspectives on Regulatory Compliance in Software Engineering,,"Department of Information Systems, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA; Department of Information Systems, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA",18-Nov-21,"Compliance reviews within a software organization are internal attempts to verify regulatory and security requirements during product development before its release. However, these reviews are not enough to adequately assess and address regulatory and security requirements throughout a software's development lifecycle. We believe requirements engineers can benefit from an improved understanding of how software practitioners treat and perceive compliance requirements. This paper describes an interview study seeking to understand how regulatory and security standard requirements are addressed, how burdensome they may be for businesses, and how our participants perceived them in the software development lifecycle. We interviewed 15 software practitioners from 13 organizations with different roles in the software development process and working in various industry domains, including big tech, healthcare, data analysis, finance, and small businesses. Our findings suggest that, for our participants, the software release process is the ultimate focus for regulatory and security compliance reviews. Also, most participants suggested that having a defined process for addressing compliance requirements was freeing rather than burdensome. Finally, participants generally saw compliance requirements as an investment for both employees and customers.

These documents are well-established sources of requirements in software engineering. However, privacy policies are written in natural language, thus subject to ambiguity and abstraction. Eliciting requirements from privacy policies is a challenging task as these ambiguities can result in more than one interpretation of a given information type (e.g., ambiguous information type ""device information"" in the statement ""we collect your device information""). To address this challenge, we propose an automated approach to infer semantic relations among information types and construct an ontology to guide requirements authors in the selection of the most appropriate information type terms. Our solution utilizes word embeddings and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify information type pairs as either hypernymy, synonymy, or unknown.

Due to the complexity of software, it is impossible (and undesirable) to achieve full transparency throughout the system. However, transparency can be improved for selected system aspects.

In this paper, we introduce reddit as a new potential data source and explore if and how requirements engineering and software evolution can benefit from obtaining user feedback from reddit. We also present an exploratory study in which we analysed the usage characteristics (i.e., frequency of posts, number of comments, and number of users for each subreddit) of reddit posts about software applications. Furthermore, we examined the content of the posts and the results reveal that almost 54% of posts contain useful information. Finally, we investigated the potential of automatic classification and applied machine learning algorithms to unstructured and noisy reddit data to perform automated classification into the categories of bug reports, feature related, and irrelevant.

However, it is hard to manually manage and grasp a large amount of user comments, which can be redundant and of a different quality. Consequently, researchers suggested automated approaches to extract valuable comments, e.g., through problem report classifiers. However, these approaches do not aggregate semantically similar comments into specific aspects to provide insights like how often users reported a certain problem.We introduce an approach for automatically discovering topics composed of semantically similar user comments based on deep bidirectional natural language processing algorithms.

These issues are further aggravated when problem descriptions are long, which makes it hard to trace modelling decisions from domain models to problem descriptions or vice-versa leading to completeness and conciseness issues. Automated support for tracing domain modelling decisions in both directions is thus advantageous. In this paper, we propose an automated approach that uses artificial intelligence techniques to extract domain models along with their trace links.

However, in order to incorporate this NFR into systems, we need to understand what explainability means from a software engineering perspective and how it impacts other quality aspects in a system. This allows for an early analysis of the benefits and possible design issues that arise from interrelationships between different quality aspects. Nevertheless, explainability is currently under-researched in the domain of requirements engineering and there is a lack of conceptual models and knowledge catalogues that support the requirements engineering process and system design.

Previous work has proposed ways for automatically extracting requirements, bug reports and other valuable information from feedback. However, little is actually known about how user feedback— especially the one available through newer channels, such as social media—is incorporated in development processes. To date, only a few case studies discuss the matter and the results are not always consistent. We carried out a mixed methods study to understand the current state of practice of harnessing user feedback in software development. Qualitatively, we performed interviews with 18 software practitioners to get a deeper understanding of the role of user feedback in software evolution. Quantitatively, we surveyed 101 software practitioners to cross-validate the interview findings and improve the generalizability of the results. We found that feedback is captured to (1) identify bugs, features and usability issues, (2) get a better understanding of the user, and (3) prioritize requirements. Our results indicate that analyzing feedback is time-consuming and has a number of challenges. Among them, feedback is typically analyzed manually and is spread over a wide range of channels and company departments.

Understanding how this process takes place can help in solving possible communication issues as well as their consequences. In this work, we perform an exploratory study of descriptive nature to understand in which way requirements get transformed from initial ideas into documented needs. To this end, we select 30 subjects that act as requirements analysts, and we perform a set of elicitation sessions with a fictional customer. The customer is required to study a sample requirements document for a system beforehand and to answer the questions of the analysts about the system. After the elicitation sessions, the analysts produce user stories for the system. These are compared with the original ones by two researchers to assess to which extent and in which way the initial requirements evolved throughout the interactive sessions. Our results show that between 30% and 38% of the produced user stories include content that can be fully traced to the initial ones, while the rest of the content is dedicated to new requirements. We also show what types of requirements are introduced through the elicitation process, and how they vary depending on the analyst.

Therefore, it is of vital importance to train future software engineers in RE and educate future requirements engineers to adequately manage requirements in various projects. However, to date there exists no central concept of what the most useful educational approaches are in RE education in order to best interweave theory with practice. To lay the foundation for this important mission, we conducted a systematic literature review.

Despite technological advances, research questions remain open about improving the level of trust and quality (quality in terms of ISO 25010) that can be placed on such ML-based systems. Their quality depends on the quality of the data used for training and appropriate verification and validation. This data quality - and with it the confidence in ML - relies on a systematic and structured process incorporating hierarchical requirements engineering for the quality and composition of data sets.This paper presents the data-driven engineering process (DDE process) as a new systematic and structured approach for leveraging future application of ML in industry. The DDE process includes hierarchical requirements engineering to link the operational design domain with the requirements and semi-automated generation of data sets. We describe the DDE process as a Vmodel that is fully integrated with other engineering processes. It represents a consistent approach that harmonizes development abstraction levels and DDE for ML as a third technology next to hardware and software (section III). Furthermore, the DDE process allows process automation leading to automated data set compilation. Applicability of the DDE process is shown by an application example using a convolutional neural network for traffic light detection (section IV).

RASAECO: Requirements Analysis of Software for the AECO Industry,,Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW); Catenda AS; Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW),18-Nov-21,"Digitalization is forging its path in the architecture, engineering, construction, operation (AECO) industry. This trend demands not only solutions for data governance but also sophisticated cyber-physical systems with a high variety of stakeholder background and very complex requirements. Existing approaches to general requirements engineering ignore the context of the AECO industry. This makes it harder for the software engineers usually lacking the knowledge of the industry context to elicit, analyze and structure the requirements and to effectively communicate with AECO professionals. To live up to that task, we present an approach and a tool for collecting AECO-specific software requirements with the aim to foster reuse and leverage domain knowledge. We introduce a common scenario space, propose a novel choice of an ubiquitous language well-suited for this particular industry and develop a systematic way to refine the scenario ontologies based on the exploration of the scenario space.

The challenge lay in taking objective factors like the cost-benefit ratio and technical dependencies of the requests into account while creating a high level of stakeholder satisfaction with the defined release scope. Together with the organisation, we have designed and implemented a tailored method that uses the stakeholders’ satisfaction as a structured means for validating the criteria-based prioritisation results. The paper extends prior work by taking the perspective of the organisational stakeholders and describing the method design from the organisation’s perspective, reports the use of the method in the organisation, and summarises the lessons learned from using the method in the organisation.

In this paper, we study crowd-based elicitation within a large governmental organization. We conduct two case studies of CrowdRE within the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee. For this, we construct the KMar-Crowd method, which adapts CrowdRE ideas to the needs of governmental organizations. While one case compares the crowd-generated ideas with requirements elicited via interviews and similar techniques, the other measures the usefulness of the gathered ideas for a product for which no prior elicitation was conducted. The results of the case studies, which attracted larger crowds than in previous studies, indicate that CrowdRE can be successfully applied to engage the users of a software product in requirements elicitation.

Early detection of NFRs enables their incorporation into the architectural design at an initial stage, a practice obviously preferable to expensive refactoring at a later stage. Automated identification and classification of NFRs has therefore seen numerous efforts using rule-based, machine learning and deep learning-based approaches. One of the major challenges for such an automation is the manual effort that needs to be invested into labeling of training data. This is a concern for large software vendors who typically work on a variety of applications in diverse domains. We address this challenge by designing a pipeline that facilitates classification of NFRs using only a limited amount (~ 20% of an available new dataset) of labeled data for training. We (1) employed Snorkel to automatically label a dataset comprising NFRs from various Software Requirement Specification documents, (2) trained several classifiers using it, and (3) reused these pre-trained classifiers using a Transfer Learning approach to classify NFRs in industry-specific datasets.

Refining User Stories via Example Mapping: An Empirical Investigation,,"Info Support, Veenendaal, the Netherlands; Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands",18-Nov-21,"New techniques for managing, specifying, and analyzing requirements in software engineering projects are frequently presented by consultants and agile trainers. However, the effectiveness of these techniques is not evaluated in a rigorous manner, leaving practitioners with the question “Will it work in our company?” In this paper, we investigate the performance of a user story refinement technique named Example Mapping (EM). This is a time-boxed workshop in which people from different disciplines work collaboratively in order to refine, or clarify, a user story with the use of examples. The creation of such examples is intended not only to obtain a more precise specification, but also and mostly to achieve shared understanding on the user story to develop among the team members. We investigate the performance of EM via two longitudinal case studies. To enable a rigorous validation of EM, we first define the Refinement Evaluation Tool (RET), a survey-based measurement instrument that extends the Method Evaluation Model with questions that cover the shared understanding dimension. The results from our case studies show that EM contributes to the shared understanding within a team; certain conditions are necessary: the user stories should not be too small-sized.

Different visual models are offered for supporting the derivation of requirements from, e.g., goals and emotions; however, we found no visualization techniques that support the elicitation and specification of requirements derived from known human barriers. The recruitment of Service Design visualization methods for visually expressing such barriers may help bridge this gap. This paper presents this vision and a demonstration for the case of Electronic Health Records, utilizing the Causal Loop Diagram to represent clinicians’ barriers when using a system. The visualization enabled by the diagram allows, for example, identification of use cases in which the system output may be overloaded with information (inducing cognitive overload) and still lacking relevant information (e.g., patient information beyond their clinical data), ultimately leading to suboptimal clinical decisions.

More recent research focuses on automating model-based decisions, such as requirements revision, by exploiting data generated at execution time.Uncertainty is considered a first-class citizen in SAS engineering. A well recognised technique for dealing with uncertainty is risk management. Several risk management methods exist, as well as visual modelling languages that aim at supporting risk analysis.Our objective is to investigate how complementing requirements modelling with risk modelling could support automating risk-driven requirements analysis. While risk could be identified and modelled at design-time using domain knowledge and data generated by previous system executions, their estimation will be done at run-time, and guide the selection of system behaviour that minimises the risk of the system not being compliant with requirements.In this paper, we introduce our research objective that concerns the definition of an engineering framework, called Risk4SAS, that enables risk-driven requirements analysis in SASs life-cycle and describe first steps towards its realisation, including a meta-model, which captures the dependency between risk and the characteristics of a SAS’s variants.

Multiple types of relationships are mentioned in the RE literatures including normal (e.g., dependency) and abnormal ones (e.g., conflicts), and most of the existing work usually focus on the identification of one specific relationship. We collect and analyze the relations in the RE literatures, and find some common semantic elements of functional requirements are involved in the definition of multiple types of relations. Thus, to support automatically identifying diverse relationships, we propose our definition of the micro-level semantic constitution of functional requirement (M-FRDL), and one automatic approach for the element extraction, named by Micro-level Semantic elements Analyser of functional requirement (MISA). The experiments with three open requirement datasets show that our MISA can correctly identify about 94.93% elements of requirements on average.",10.1109/RE51729.2021.00048,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604605,Software Requirements Relationships;Semantic Elements;Natural Language Processing,1,IEEE Conferences,,W.

A Web Accessibility Requirements Framework for Agile Development,,"NOVA LINCS, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal",18-Nov-21,"In the Software Engineering area, Web Accessibility is gaining more space, establishing itself as an important quality attribute. In the context of agile development, approaching this type of requirement by development teams is still a challenging task, as there is often a lack of knowledge about the domain and a lack of methods or tools to support the specification of accessibility requirements, which end up being neglected or considered only in the final phase of the projects. Therefore, this work proposes the development of a framework to support the specification of web accessibility requirements in an agile context. The framework consists of automating the reuse of accessibility requirements, supporting the generation of artifacts, such as user stories, thus improving communication between stakeholders and supporting the analysis of the possible impact of these accessibility requirements on other system features.",10.1109/RE51729.2021.00071,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604684,Web Accessibility;Agile Development;Requirements Engineering,1,IEEE Conferences,,D.

Requirements prioritization based on multiple criteria using Artificial Intelligence techniques,,"Fac. Informática, Database Lab. Elviña, Universidade da Coruña, CITIC, A Coruña, Spain",18-Nov-21,"Traditional methods for requirements prioritization (RP) are currently limited by scalability and lack of automation issues. In recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in different areas of software engineering (e.g., requirements analysis, testing, maintenance). In particular, I have found thirteen RP methods applying AI techniques such as machine learning, or genetic algorithms. 38% of these approaches seek to improve the scalability problem, whereas only 15% of them aim to improve the automation aspect along the RP process. Moreover, all these studies have carried out their evaluations with a number of requirements no greater than 100.In order to address the issues of scalability and lack of automation in RP, the present research project aims to propose a semi-automatic multiple-criteria prioritization method for functional and non-functional requirements of software projects developed within the Software Product-Lines paradigm. The proposed RP method will be based on the combination of Natural Language Processing techniques and Machine Learning algorithms, and for its validation, empirical studies will be carried out with real web-based geographic information systems (GIS).

Towards the development of the cybersecurity concept according to ISO/SAE 21434 using model-based systems engineering,,"Product Engineering, Fraunhofer IEM, Paderborn, Germany",18-Nov-21,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous vehicles, are intelligent and networked. Close collaboration between stakeholders from different disciplines is necessary right from the start of development. In the automotive sector in particular, the collaboration of the car manufacturer extends to several suppliers. The increasing complexity in the design of such CPSs makes interdisciplinary and cross-company collaboration more difficult. Here, requirements specifications serve as a support for communication. A lack of overall understanding of such CPSs and their numerous interfaces jeopardizes the assurance of safety-relevant security. ISO/SAE 21434, which applies to the automotive industry, requires the creation of a cybersecurity concept at the beginning of the product development process. The problem is that ISO/SAE 21434 only prescribes WHAT must be done, but does not define HOW this is supposed to be done methodically.Existing methods are not applicable to the concept phase without extensive tailoring, according to the challenges I identified in this paper and the literature review I conducted.

A comprehensive approach to identifying key stakeholders in complicated software ecosystems,,"School of Business, Maynooth University, Co Kildare, Ireland",18-Nov-21,"Software stakeholders are critical to the success of software development projects, because they influence the strategic direction, the financial backing, and have specific knowledge – all of which sustains the software being developed. As the complexity of software environments increase, and expectations for cross-product integration heighten, there is more pressure on actors within software ecosystems (SECOs) to work in unison to produce reliably integrated software, efficiently. Recently collected empirical findings show that requirements managers working in SECO environments believe that all key stakeholders can be identified, but that it requires analysis, investigation and expert knowledge. Until now, the existing frameworks describing stakeholder identification do not take into account the level of dependencies that occur in SECOs nor the implications on SECO health. This research proposes that a structured comprehensive approach to identifying stakeholders in SECOs would provide practitioners the guidance they need to avoid the common pitfalls of poor stakeholder identification, including late requirements from critical stakeholders which can risk the software release schedule, software quality, and scope.",10.1109/RE51729.2021.00074,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604541,stakeholder identification;requirements elicitation;software ecosystems,2,IEEE Conferences,,S.

Non-functional requirements (NFR), which include performance, availability, and maintainability, are vitally important to overall software quality. Research has shown NFRs are, in practice, poorly defined and difficult to verify, especially in agile environments. Continuous software engineering (CSE) practices, which extend agile practices, emphasize fast paced, automated, and rapid release of software that poses additional challenges to NFRs. However, the level of shared understanding achieved across an organization is not well-understood.

User stories’ popularity among practitioners and their template-based structure make them ideal candidates for the application of natural language processing techniques. In our research, we have found that circa 50% of real-world user stories contain easily preventable linguistic defects. To mitigate this problem, we have created tool-supported methods that facilitate the creation of better user stories.

Trace Link Recovery using Semantic Relation Graphs and Spreading Activation,,"Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany",09-Oct-20,"Trace Link Recovery tries to identify and link related existing requirements with each other to support further engineering tasks. Existing approaches are mainly based on algebraic Information Retrieval or machine-learning. Machinelearning approaches usually demand reasonably large and labeled datasets to train. Algebraic Information Retrieval approaches like distance between tf-idf scores also work on smaller datasets without training but are limited in providing explanations for trace links. In this work, we present a Trace Link Recovery approach that is based on an explicit representation of the content of requirements as a semantic relation graph and uses Spreading Activation to answer trace queries over this graph. Our approach is fully automated including an NLP pipeline to transform unrestricted natural language requirements into a graph. We evaluate our approach on five common datasets. Depending on the selected configuration, the predictive power strongly varies. With the best tested configuration, the approach achieves a mean average precision of 40% and a Lag of 50%.

Same Same but Different: Finding Similar User Feedback Across Multiple Platforms and Languages,,University of Zurich; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,09-Oct-20,"Users submit feedback about the software they use through application distributions platforms, i.e., app stores, and social media. Previous research has found that this type of feedback contains valuable information for software evolution, such as bug reports, or feature requests. However, popular applications receive thousands of feedback entities per day, making their manual analysis unrealistic. In this work, we present an approach to automatically identify similar user feedback across different languages and platforms. At the core of the approach is a word aligner that aligns words based on their semantic similarity and the similarity of their local semantic contexts. Additionally, we make use of machine translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification, to extract the sentiment polarity and content nature of user feedback written in different languages. We use the results of these components to compute a similarity score between user feedback pairs. We evaluated our approach on user feedback entities written in four different languages, and retrieved from five different mobile applications obtained from four different app stores and social networking sites. The obtained results are encouraging. Compared to human assessment, the overall performance for monolingual user feedback pairs yielded a strong correlation of 0.79.

Voice of the Users: A Demographic Study of Software Feedback Behaviour,,"University of Auckland, New Zealand; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany; University of Auckland, New Zealand",09-Oct-20,"User feedback on mobile app stores, product forums, and on social media can contain product development insights. There has been a lot of recent research studying this feedback and developing methods to automatically extract requirement-related information. This feedback is generally considered to be the “voice of the users”; however, only a subset of software users provide online feedback. If the demographics of the online feedback givers are not representative of the user base, this introduces the possibility of developing software that does not meet the needs of all users. It is, therefore, important to understand who provides online feedback to ensure the needs of under-represented groups are not being missed.In this work, we directly survey 1040 software users about their feedback habits, software use, and demographic information. Their responses indicate that there are statistically significant differences in who gives feedback on each online channel, with respect to traditional demographics (gender, age, etc). We also identify key differences in what motivates software users to engage with each of the three channels. Our findings provide valuable context for requirements elicited from online feedback and show that considering information from all channels will provide a more comprehensive view of user needs.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218201,,15,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Inc, Calgary, Canada",09-Oct-20,"Context: Incomplete or incorrect detection of requirement dependencies has proven to result in reduced release quality and substantial rework. Additionally, the extraction of dependencies is challenging since requirements are mostly documented in natural language, which makes it a cognitively difficult task. Moreover, with ever-changing and new requirements, a manual analysis process must be repeated, which imposes extra hardship even for domain experts. Objective: The three main objectives of this research are: 1) Proposing a new dependency extraction method using a variant of Active Learning (AL). 2) Evaluating this AL and Ontology-based Retrieval (OBR) as baseline methods for dependency extraction on the two industrial data sets. 3) Analyzing the value gained from integrating these diverse approaches to form two hybrid methods. Method: Building on the general AL, ensemble and semi-supervised machine learning, a variant of AL was developed, which was further integrated with OBR to form two hybrid methods (Hybrid1, Hybrid2) for extracting three types of dependencies (requires, refines, other): Hybrid1 used OBR as a substitute for human expert; Hybrid2 used dependencies extracted through the OBR as an additional input for training set in AL. Results: For two industrial case studies, AL extracted more dependencies than OBR. Hybrid1 showed improvement for both data sets. For one of them, F1 score increased to 82.6% compared to the AL baseline score of 49.9%. Hybrid2 increased the accuracy by 25% to the level of 75.8% compared to the AL baseline accuracy. OBR also complemented the AL approach by reducing 50% of the human effort.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218190,Requirements dependencies;dependency extraction;active learning;domain ontologies;hybrid method;empirical evaluation;industrial data,15,IEEE Conferences,,G.

The Lack of Shared Understanding of Non-Functional Requirements in Continuous Software Engineering: Accidental or Essential?,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada; Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada; Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada; Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada",09-Oct-20,"Building shared understanding of requirements is key to ensuring downstream software activities are efficient and effective. However, in continuous software engineering (CSE) some lack of shared understanding is an expected, and essential, part of a rapid feedback learning cycle. At the same time, there is a key trade-off with avoidable costs, such as rework, that come from accidental gaps in shared understanding. This tradeoff is even more challenging for non-functional requirements (NFRs), which have significant implications for product success. Comprehending and managing NFRs is especially difficult in small, agile organizations. How such organizations manage shared understanding of NFRs in CSE is understudied. We conducted a case study of three small organizations scaling up CSE to further understand and identify factors that contribute to lack of shared understanding of NFRs, and its relationship to rework. Our in-depth analysis identified 41 NFR-related software tasks as rework due to a lack of shared understanding of NFRs. Of these 41 tasks 78% were due to avoidable (accidental) lack of shared understanding of NFRs. Using a mixed-methods approach we identify factors that contribute to lack of shared understanding of NFRs, such as the lack of domain knowledge, rapid pace of change, and cross-organizational communication problems. We also identify recommended strategies to mitigate lack of shared understanding through more effective management of requirements knowledge in such organizations.

How developers believe Invisibility impacts NFRs related to User Interaction,,"Computer Science Department (DC), Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, Brazil; Computer Science Department (DC), Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, Brazil; Laboratory of Industrial and Human Automation Control, Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science, Université Polytechnique Hauts-de-France, Valenciennes, LAMIH UMR CNRS 8201, France",09-Oct-20,"The advance of Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) and Internet of Things (IoT) brought a new set of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), especially related to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Invisibility is one of these NFRs, and it refers to either the merging of technology in the user environment or the decrease of the interaction workload. This new NFR may impact traditional NFRs (e.g., Usability), revealing positive correlations, when one NFR helps another, and negative correlations, when a procedure favors an NFR but creates difficulty for another one. Software engineers need to know about these correlations, so they can select appropriate strategies to satisfy Invisibility and traditional NFRs. Correlations between NFRs are usually stored in catalogs, which is a well-defined body of knowledge gathered from previous experience. Although Invisibility has been recently cataloged with development strategies, the literature still lacks catalogs with correlations for this NFR. Therefore, this work aims at capturing and cataloging invisibility correlations for UbiComp and IoT systems. To do that, we also propose to systematize the definition of correlations using the following well-defined research methods: Interview, Content Analysis and Questionnaire. As a result, we defined a catalog with 110 positive and negative correlations with 9 NFRs. This well-defined body of knowledge is useful for supporting software engineers to select strategies to satisfy Invisibility and other NFRs related to user interaction.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218217,invisibility;correlation;cooperation;conflict;non-functional requirement;catalog,6,IEEE Conferences,,R.

OASIS: Weakening User Obligations for Security-critical Systems,,"The Open University, UK; The Open University, UK; The Open University, UK",09-Oct-20,"Security-critical systems typically place some requirements on the behaviour of their users, obliging them to follow certain instructions when using those systems. Security vulnerabilities can arise when users do not fully satisfy their obligations. In this paper, we propose an approach that improves system security by ensuring that attack scenarios are mitigated even when the users deviate from their expected behaviour. The approach uses structured transition systems to present and reason about user obligations. The aim is to identify potential vulnerabilities by weakening the assumptions on how the user will behave. We present an algorithm that combines iterative abstraction and controller synthesis to produce a new software specification that maintains the satisfaction of security requirements while weakening user obligations.

Therefore, a major challenge in RE is to decide how much RE is needed and what RE methods to apply. The quality of such decisions is strongly based on the RE expert's experience and expertise in carefully analyzing the context and current state of a project. Recent work, however, shows that lack of experience and qualification are common causes for problems in RE. We trained a series of Bayesian Networks on data from the NaPiRE survey to model relationships between RE problems, their causes, and effects in projects with different contextual characteristics. These models were used to conduct (1) a post-mortem (diagnostic) analysis, deriving probable causes of suboptimal RE performance, and (2) to conduct a preventive analysis, predicting probable issues a young project might encounter.

In Europe, privacy policies are subject to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If done entirely manually, checking whether a given privacy policy complies with GDPR is both time-consuming and error-prone. Automated support for this task is thus advantageous. At the moment, there is an evident lack of such support on the market. In this paper, we tackle an important dimension of GDPR compliance checking for privacy policies. Specifically, we provide automated support for checking whether the content of a given privacy policy is complete according to the provisions stipulated by GDPR. To do so, we present: (1) a conceptual model to characterize the information content envisaged by GDPR for privacy policies, (2) an AI-assisted approach for classifying the information content in GDPR privacy policies and subsequently checking how well the classified content meets the completeness criteria of interest; and (3) an evaluation of our approach through a case study over 24 unseen privacy policies. For classification, we leverage a combination of Natural Language Processing and supervised Machine Learning. Our experimental material is comprised of 234 real privacy policies from the fund industry. Our empirical results indicate that our approach detected 45 of the total of 47 incompleteness issues in the 24 privacy policies it was applied to.

Extracting and Classifying Requirements from Software Engineering Contracts,,"TCS Research, Pune, India; TCS Research, Pune, India; TCS Research, Pune, India; TCS Research, Pune, India",09-Oct-20,"In this paper, we present our work on extracting and classifying requirements from large software engineering contracts. Typically, the process of requirements elicitation begins after a contractual agreement is signed by all participants. Our interactions with the legal compliance team in a large vendor organization reveal that business contracts can help in the identification of high-level requirements relevant to the success of software engineering projects. We posit that requirements engineering as a discipline has an even wider scope than software engineering of which it is traditionally considered to be a sub-discipline. This is because software engineering-specific requirements are but a part of the success story of any large project. The requirements that emerge from contracts are obligatory in nature, whether or not they pertain to core software development. Therefore, it is important that these are extracted and classified for the benefit of software engineers and other stakeholders responsible for a project. We discuss the results of an exploratory study and a range of experiments from the use of regular expressions to Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for automating the extraction and classification of requirements from software engineering contracts.

However, legal texts often express obligations only indirectly, for example, by attributing a right to the counterpart. This phenomenon has already been described in the Requirements Engineering (RE) literature [1]. Objectives: We investigate the use of requirements templates for the systematic elicitation of legal requirements. Our work is motivated by two observations: (1) The existing literature does not provide a harmonized view on the requirements templates that are useful for legal RE; (2) Despite the promising recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), automated support for legal RE through the suggestion of requirements templates has not been achieved yet. Our objective is to take steps toward addressing these limitations. Methods: We review and reconcile the legal requirement templates proposed in RE. Subsequently, we conduct a qualitative study to define NLP rules for template recommendation. Results and Conclusions: Our contributions consist of (a) a harmonized list of requirements templates pertinent to legal RE, and (b) rules for the automatic recommendation of such templates. We evaluate our rules through a case study on 400 statements from two legal domains. The results indicate a recall and precision of 82,3% and 79,8%, respectively. We show that introducing some limited interaction with the analyst considerably improves accuracy.

It leads to misconception about technical terminologies, and impacts the readability and understandability of requirements negatively. Manual detection entity coreference is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a DEEP context-wise semantic method named DeepCoref to entity COREFerence detection. It consists of one fine-tuning BERT model for context representation and a Word2Vec-based network for entity representation. We use a multi-layer perception in the end to fuse and make a trade-off between two representations for obtaining a better representation of entities. The input of the network is requirement contextual text and related entities, and the output is the predictive label to infer whether two entities are coreferent.

Digital Discrimination in Sharing Economy A Requirements Engineering Perspective,,"The Division of Computer Science and Engineering, Louisiana State University; The Division of Computer Science and Engineering, Louisiana State University; The Division of Computer Science and Engineering, Louisiana State University",09-Oct-20,"Recent evidence has revealed that Sharing Economy platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit, have become active hubs for digital discrimination. This new form of discrimination refers to a phenomenon where a business transaction is influenced by race, gender, age, or any other non-business related characteristic of providers or consumers. Existing research often tackles this problem from a socio-economic and regulatory points of view.

To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a new perspective on digital discrimination, tackling the problem from a Requirements Engineering point of view.

The authors present the results of an empirical study aimed at characterizing and analyzing recurrent requirement management weaknesses in automotive. The authors, as Automotive SPICE assessors, have evaluated requirement management practices on the basis of the evidences gathered from real industrial development projects during a significant number of assessments performed at several organizations world-wide. This paper is intended to derive a picture of the state-of-the-practice of requirements management in automotive focusing on the development of software-intensive automotive components. The purpose is to provide researchers and practitioners with a reference for improvement initiatives aimed at solving those weaknesses.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00037,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218191,Automotive;Process Improvement;Automotive SPICETM;Requirements Management,,IEEE Conferences,,F.

Towards a Taxonomy for Eliciting Design-Operation Continuum Requirements of Cyber-Physical Systems,,University of Mondragon; Ikerlan; University of Mondragon; Mälardalen University; Mälardalen University; Ikerlan; University of Mondragon; Orona; Bombardier Transportation,09-Oct-20,"Software systems that are embedded in autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) usually have a large life-cycle, both during its development and in maintenance. This software evolves during its life-cycle in order to incorporate new requirements, bug fixes, and to deal with hardware obsolescence. The current process for developing and maintaining this software is very fragmented, which makes developing new software versions and deploying them in the CPSs extremely expensive. In other domains, such as web engineering, the phases of development and operation are tightly connected, making it possible to easily perform software updates of the system, and to obtain operational data that can be analyzed by engineers at development time. However, in spite of the rise of new communication technologies (e.g., 5G) providing an opportunity to acquire Design-Operation Continuum Engineering methods in the context of CPSs, there are still many complex issues that need to be addressed, such as the ones related with hardware-software co-design. Therefore, the process of Design-Operation Continuum Engineering for CPSs requires substantial changes with respect to the current fragmented software development process. In this paper, we build a taxonomy for Design-Operation Continuum Engineering of CPSs based on case studies from two different industrial domains involving CPSs (elevation and railway). This taxonomy is later used to elicit requirements from these two case studies in order to present a blueprint on adopting Design-Operation Continuum Engineering in any organization developing CPSs.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00038,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218194,DevOps;Design-Operation;Requirements Elicitation;Cyber-Physical Systems,15,IEEE Conferences,,J.

An Analysis of Requirements-Related Problems that Occurred in an organization Using a Mature Requirements Engineering Process,,"Teradyne, Inc., North Reading, USA",09-Oct-20,"Plenty has been written on the necessary elements of a requirements engineering (RE) process. When an organization experiences product development problems and is found to lack an effective RE process, it is relatively easy to find potential causes for the problems. For example, changes may not have been managed, or requirements and other artifacts may not have been traced to each other. Nevertheless, what can be said of RE process failures that occur despite an organization's using a reasonably mature RE process? This paper will examine a set of RE-related problems that occurred in one such organization. It will also describe a solution that has been proposed to avoid such problems in the future.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00039,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218198,Requirements engineering process;requirements engineering process failures;traceability,,IEEE Conferences,,M.

MATLAB/Simulink is a development and simulation framework that is widely used in industry to capture such systems. In this paper, we report on the application of NASA Ames tools to perform end-to-end analysis of the Ten Lockheed Martin Challenge Problems (LMCPS). LMCPS is a set of industrial Simulink model benchmarks and natural language requirements developed by domain experts. Our framework, which integrates the tools FRET and COCOSIM, is used to: 1) elicit, explain, and formalize the semantics of the given natural language requirements; 2) generate verification code and monitors that can be automatically attached to the Simulink models; 3) perform verification by using SMT-based model checkers.

Early Requirements Traceability with Domain-Specific Taxonomies - A Pilot Experiment,,"Department of Software Engineering, Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden",09-Oct-20,"Background: Establishing traceability from requirements documents to downstream artifacts early can be beneficial as it allows engineers to reason about requirements quality (e.g. completeness, consistency, redundancy). However, creating such early traces is difficult if downstream artifacts do not exist yet. Objective: We propose to use domain-specific taxonomies to establish early traceability, raising the value and perceived benefits of trace links so that they are also available at later development phases, e.g. in design, testing or maintenance. Method: We developed a recommender system that suggests trace links from requirements to a domain-specific taxonomy based on a series of heuristics. We designed a controlled experiment to compare industry practitioners' efficiency, accuracy, consistency and confidence with and without support from the recommender. Results: We have piloted the experimental material with seven practitioners. The analysis of self-reported confidence suggests that the trace task itself is very challenging as both control and treatment group report low confidence on correctness and completeness. Conclusions: As a pilot, the experiment was successful since it provided initial feedback on the performance of the recommender, insight on the experimental material and illustrated that the collected data can be meaningfully analysed.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00042,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218209,Traceability;Requirements;Domain-specific Taxonomy;Recommender;Pilot Experiment,2,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Automated tracing techniques need to leverage the semantics of underlying artifacts in order to establish more accurate trace links and to provide explanations of links that have been created in either a manual or automated fashion. To support this, we propose an automated technique which leverages source code, project artifacts and an external domain corpus to generate a domain-specific concept model. We then use the generated concept model to improve traceability results and to provide explanations of the results. Our approach overcomes existing problems with deep-learning traceability algorithms, as it does not require a training set of existing trace links. Finally, as an initial proof-of-concept, we apply our semantically-guided approach to the Dronology project, and show that it improves over other tracing techniques that do not use a concept model.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00043,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218137,Traceability;Repository Mining;Concept Model;Semantic Analysis;Domain Specified Ontology,4,IEEE Conferences,,Y.

One such formalism is domain modelling which bridges the gap between requirements expressed in natural language and analyzable and more concise domain models expressed in class diagrams. Due to the lack of modelling skills among novice modellers and time constraints in industrial projects, it is often not possible to build an accurate domain model manually. To address this challenge, we aim to develop an approach to extract domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language by combining rules based on natural language processing with machine learning. As a first step, we report on an automated and tool-supported approach with an accuracy of extracted domain models higher than existing approaches. In addition, the approach generates trace links for each model element of a domain model. The trace links enable novice modellers to execute queries on the extracted domain models to gain insights into the modelling decisions taken for improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, to evaluate our approach, we propose a novel comparison metric and discuss our experimental design.

The first problem is the common differentiation between “functional” and “non-functional” requirements, which hides relevant sustainability requirements and hampers their identification. The second problem is the lack of developer-oriented representation approaches to ensure that all requirements relevant to sustainable software will be finally implemented. To address these two issues ShapeRE provides an alternative multi-dimensional approach for identifying requirements and a developer-oriented representation guideline. We suggest nine dimensions which are social, economic, environmental, technical, individual, purpose, design-aesthetics, integrative and legal.

Automated Goal Model Extraction from User Stories Using NLP,,"Boğaziçi University, Turkey; Boğaziçi University, Turkey",09-Oct-20,"User stories are commonly used to capture user needs in agile methods due to their ease of learning and understanding. Yet, the simple structure of user stories prevents us from capturing relations among them. Such relations help the developers to better understand and structure the backlog items derived from the user stories. One solution to this problem is to build goal models that provide explicit relations among goals but require time and effort to build. This paper presents a pipeline to automatically generate a goal model from a set of user stories by applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques and our initial heuristics to build realistic goal models. We first parse and identify the dependencies in the user stories, and store the results in a graph database to maintain the relations among the roles, actions, and objects mentioned in the set of user stories. By applying NLP techniques and several heuristics, we generate goal models that resemble human-built models. Automatically generating models significantly decreases the time spent on this tedious task. Our research agenda includes calculating the similarity between the automatically generated models and the expert-built models. Our overarching research goals are to provide i. an NLP-powered framework that generates goal models from a set of user stories, ii. several heuristics to generate goal models that resemble human-built models, and iii. a repository that includes sets of user stories, with corresponding human-built and automatically generated goal models.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00052,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218185,natural language processing;requirements engineering;model driven development;user stories;agile development;goal models,13,IEEE Conferences,,T.

Requirements-Collector: Automating Requirements Specification from Elicitation Sessions and User Feedback,,"Zurich University of Applied Sciences, Winterthur, Switzerland; Zurich University of Applied Sciences, Winterthur, Switzerland",09-Oct-20,"In the context of digital transformation, speeding up the time-to-market of high-quality software products is a big challenge. Software quality correlates with the success of requirements engineering (RE) sessions and the ability to collect feedback from end-users in an efficient, dynamic way. Thus, software analysts are tasked to collect all relevant material of RE sessions and user feedback, usually specified on written notes, flip charts, pictures, and user reviews. Afterward comprehensible requirements need to be specified for software implementation and testing. These activities are mostly performed manually, which causes process delays, with a negative effect on software quality attributes such as reliability, usability, comprehensibility. This paper presents Requirements-Collector, a tool for automating the tasks of requirements specification and user feedback analysis. Our tool involves machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) computational mechanisms enabling the automated classification of requirements discussed in RE meetings (stored in the form of audio recordings) and textual feedback in the form of user reviews. We use such techniques as they demonstrated to be quite effective in text classification problems. We argue that Requirements-Collector has the potential to renovate the role of software analysts, which can experience a substantial reduction of manual tasks, more efficient communication, dedication to more analytical tasks, and assurance of software quality from conception phases.

Our varied industrial experience repeatedly showed, however, that even in projects with plenty of RE-budget and -efforts spent numerous problems are often found during acceptance testing that can still be traced back to incomplete or even missing requirements. How is that possible? After observing this repeatedly throughout more than eight years of industrial experience we performed a careful, in-depth qualitative analysis on the underlying root causes that lead us to the hypothesis we present in this paper: requirements engineers often tacitly lay a strong focus on one particular perspective in textbased requirements documentation, while the others typically remain un- or underspecified. Thus, incompleteness arises. In this paper we summarise our observations and present a solution idea that more explicitly considers the different perspectives during the RE process. This can significantly increase requirements completeness, lead to an improved overall balancing of RE efforts and, hence, also lead to higher chances for project success.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00058,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218146,,1,IEEE Conferences,,R.

Identifying Use Case Elements from Textual Specification: A Preliminary Study,,"DAIICT, Gandhinagar, India; ABV-IIITM, Gwalior, India; DAIICT, Gandhinagar, India; DAIICT, Gandhinagar, India",09-Oct-20,"Software requirements are described in some form of natural language (NL) text so that stakeholders with limited experience can also comprehend them easily. However, the NL text written document is inherently ambiguous, and this makes it hard to examine requirements manually to find inconsistencies, duplicates, and/or missing requirements. Use Case Analysis is a graphical depiction used to explain the interaction between the user and the system for the given user's task. Additionally, it denotes the extension/dependency of one use case to another to understand the system flow. It is often used to identify, clarify, and categorize system requirements. However, generating use cases from a textual written description of requirements is an arduous task involving a significant manual work, which can be automated using data-driven techniques. In this poster paper, we present an initial approach for the automated identification of use case names and actor names from the textual requirements specification using machine learning techniques.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00059,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218167,Use Case;Machine Learning (ML);Natural Language Processing (NLP);Requirement Engineering (RE) Language Processing (NLP);Requirement Engineering (RE),8,IEEE Conferences,,S.

Digital Transformation is increasing this importance exponentially. Despite such importance, the topic of requirements engineering in middleware has limited attention in the literature. The authors have observed in their experience that the challenges faced during the requirements elicitation for middleware projects result in poor Quality of Requirements (QoR). It is thus important to understand the characteristics, nature, structure and process of middleware requirements as well as these challenges better to be able to improve the QoR. Based on the issues faced due to unavailability of adequate data and people's time in many middleware projects in over twenty five years, the authors and their organization have developed and leveraged successfully a structured methodology to elicit and document the requirements for middleware with high quality by working around the limitations faced in such projects.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00060,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218203,Middleware;Quality of Requirements;Requirements Specifications;Interface Requirements Definition;Digital Transformation,2,IEEE Conferences,,V.

Priority-Awareness of Non-Functional Requirements under Uncertainty,,"SEA, Aston University, Birmingham, UK",09-Oct-20,"A Self-adaptive system (SAS) is required to continuously satisfy its requirements at runtime under environmental uncertainty. As the run-time context changes, the system may need to re-conFigure itself, and since resources are finite this may require trade-offs between the SAS's non-functional requirements (NFRs). A number of runtime modelling techniques have been developed for resolution of uncertainty in SASs. However, current techniques lack the explicit runtime representation of NFR priorities, leading to the risk that adaptations may fail to respect the NFRs' priorities. In order to address this problem, my research will focus on the explicit representation and a priori elicitation of distinct NFRs' priorities to support autonomous NFR tradeoff decisions. This paper gives an overview of the research area by identifying gaps in existing state of the art techniques. The paper also provides a description of the prospective approaches for solving the problem along with current progress made and next steps.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00061,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218153,non-functional requirements;priorities;uncertainty;self-adaptive systems,4,IEEE Conferences,,H.

Security & Safety by Model-based Requirements Engineering,,"Fraunhofer Research Institute for Mechatronic Systems Design IEM, Paderborn, Germany",09-Oct-20,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS), like autonomous vehicles, are intelligent and networked. The development of such systems requires interdisciplinary cooperation between different stakeholders. A lack of system understanding between stakeholders can lead to unidentified security threats & safety hazards in requirements engineering, resulting in high costs in product development. In particular, a lack of an integrative consideration of security threats & safety hazards can compromise safety compliance for CPS. Model-based requirements engineering (MBRE) improves the understanding of systems between stakeholders by additionally creating supporting models to system requirements. However, MBRE approaches only partially address security threats & safety hazards. In particular, their integrative consideration is not taken into account. Established security & safety approaches are either only applicable to specific disciplines or only partially consider security threats & safety hazards. Overall, existing approaches do not fully cover the MBRE process. In the context of this paper, the results of three scientific papers are consolidated with the aim to create a basis for a holistic MBRE approach, which considers security threats & safety hazards integratively. In each of the papers, sub-criteria of the holistic MBRE approach are presented.

Towards Automatic Capturing of Traceability Links by Combining Eye Tracking and Interaction Data,,"Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany",09-Oct-20,"Despite its numerous scientifically cited benefits, traceability is still rarely established in industrial settings. Years of research in the area have brought several different approaches to create traceability links including Information Retrieval (IR) and Machine Learning approaches. However, their accuracy and overall traceability support is not sufficient yet to be properly applied in practice. In my research, I want to investigate the usage of eye tracking and interaction data in the field of traceability. By tracking how software engineers interact with documents, where they focus on and recording gaze links between those documents, an algorithm is designed to obtain trace links between artifacts from these data. Eye tracking and interaction data have the advantage that they can be recorded in an automatic, non-intrusive way without requiring manual effort. They give detailed insight about where people focus on when working on tasks. However, software support of eye tracking is still limited, especially in the context of dynamic content such as switching between, scrolling or editing documents. Therefore, one essential step of my research is to provide software support for recording eye tracking data in dynamic document environments. By combining eye tracking data with additionally recorded metadata such as interactions, this eye tracking framework shall enable the automatic capturing of gaze links and gaze durations during software engineering tasks. The approach of using eye tracking in the context of traceability will be evaluated in several usage scenarios such as requirements coverage assessment.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00064,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218195,software traceability;eye tracking;interaction data;trace links,1,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Reducing Ambiguity in Requirements Elicitation via Gamification,,"Dept. of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Int. Islamic University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan",09-Oct-20,"The overall quality and success of software highly depends on the involvement of stakeholders. Requirements elicitation supports RE analyst to gather requirements from the stakeholders based on their needs. There are multiple elicitation techniques present in literature and used by the practitioners. Some of them are questionnaires, interviews, prototyping, and user stories etc. However, these techniques are based on textual representation of requirements. These techniques are quite common among the requirement engineers yet problems of ambiguity, inconsistency, incompleteness still exist mostly due to their textual nature and lack of stakeholder involvement. Lack of clarity about the system increases the ambiguity of what exactly are the system requirements. Since elicitation is carried at an early stage of development the users are not sure of what they want, as requirements tend to evolve with the help of discussions and interactions among various stakeholders and technical team. Furthermore, the conventional elicitation methods are limited when it comes to stakeholders' participation and involvement, thus leaving a space for more ambiguous and incomplete requirements. In this work, Gamification, a game-based context will be used in non-gaming context for user involvement in fun ways. During elicitation, gamification would help to involve and interact with the stakeholders, with an intention to develop their interest in eliciting and finalizing system requirements. The goal of this paper is to reduce ambiguity during requirements elicitation. This would help in reducing the cost and time of development. Furthermore, we will elicit software requirements using gamification by developing a gamification tool with a focus to elicit unambiguous requirements by ensuring users' participation and maintaining interest. The validation of tool would be done using multiple confirmatory case studies from software industry.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00065,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218218,ambiguity;requirements engineering;requirements elicitation;gamification;software development,10,IEEE Conferences,,H.

Towards the Specification and Verification of Legal Contracts,,"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada",09-Oct-20,"A contract is a legally binding agreement that expresses high-level requirements of parties in terms of obligations, powers and constraints. Parties' actions influence the status of a contract and shall comply with its clauses. Manual contract monitoring is very laborious in real markets, such as transactive energy, where plenty of complex contracts are running concurrently. Furthermore, liability, right and performance transition through run-time operations such as subcontracting, assignment and substitution complicate contract interpretation. Automation is needed to ensure that contracts respect desirable properties and to support monitoring of compliance and handling of violations. In this thesis research, I propose an innovative ontology that defines fundamental contractual notions (such as the ones mentioned above) and their relationships, on which is built a specification language, called Symboleo, that provides syntax and axiomatic semantics of contracts via first-order logic. Symboleo enables the development of advanced automation tools such as a compliance checker that monitors contracts at runtime, and a model checking verification method that analyzes liveness and safety properties of contracts.

Towards socio-technical requirements engineering for regulatory compliance,,,09-Oct-20,"As the digital transformation is gaining momentum in the agenda and strategic plans of both the public and the private sector, it is important to analyze how requirements engineering will contribute to the making of the digital world. From the technological perspective, software and systems engineering are `threatened' by the social dynamics and versatility that can be hardly captured with available techniques. From the social perspective, humanity is challenged with a new generation of digital systems, like social media platforms, that have a transformational impact on existing social orders. Public requirements for such systems are hardly well-specified that eventually may result in large-scale disruptions. A more systematic and holistic approach in requirements engineering addressing both the technical and the social aspects of the systems is needed. This paper outlines the hypothesis about the applicability of a socio-technical approach as a single theoretical framework for addressing simultaneously technical and social aspects of existing issues and further planned investigation of this assumption. The hypothesis is made as a part of the future PhD research on regulatory governance of software systems and particularly regulatory compliance and public requirements implementation in the requirements engineering at the particular example of media platforms.",10.1109/RE48521.2020.00067,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218210,requirements engineering;socio-technical system;regulatory compliance;digitalization;digital transformation,1,IEEE Conferences,,O.

Requirements We Live By,,"School of Computing & Communications, The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK",05-Dec-19,"Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.",10.1109/RE.2019.00009,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920530,"requirements-engineering;software-engineering,;security-and-privacy",,IEEE Conferences,,B.

"Uncertain Requirements, Assurance and Machine Learning",,"Dept. of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada",05-Dec-19,"From financial services platforms to social networks to vehicle control, software has come to mediate many activities of daily life. Governing bodies and standards organizations have responded to this trend by creating regulations and standards to address issues such as safety, security and privacy. In this environment, the compliance of software development to standards and regulations has emerged as a key requirement. Compliance claims and arguments are often captured in assurance cases, with linked evidence of compliance. Evidence can come from testcases, verification proofs, human judgement, or a combination of these. That is, we try to build (safety-critical) systems carefully according to well justified methods and articulate these justifications in an assurance case that is ultimately judged by a human. Yet software is deeply rooted in uncertainty making pragmatic assurance more inductive than deductive: most of complex open-world functionality is either not completely specifiable (due to uncertainty) or it is not cost-effective to do so, and deductive verification cannot happen without specification. Inductive assurance, achieved by sampling or testing, is easier but generalization from finite set of examples cannot be formally justified. And of course the recent popularity of constructing software via machine learning only worsens the problem - rather than being specified by predefined requirements, machine-learned components learn existing patterns from the available training data, and make predictions for unseen data when deployed. On the surface, this ability is extremely useful for hard-to specify concepts, e.g., the definition of a pedestrian in a pedestrian detection component of a vehicle. On the other, safety assessment and assurance of such components becomes very challenging. In this talk, I focus on two specific approaches to arguing about safety and security of software under uncertainty. The first one is a framework for managing uncertainty in assurance cases (for ""conventional"" and ""machine-learned"" systems) by systematically identifying, assessing and addressing it. The second is recent work on supporting development of requirements for machine-learned components in safety-critical domains.",10.1109/RE.2019.00010,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920485,"uncertainty, assurance, safety, automotive, requirements engineering, machine-learning",3,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Human Values in Software: A New Paradigm for Requirements Engineering?,,"Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia",05-Dec-19,"Requirements engineering (RE) has generally done a good job of helping to define software systems with the intended functionality and cost and that is safe, secure and reliable. However, there is a broader set of human values - such as transparency, integrity, diversity, compassion, social justice - that are largely ignored when we develop software systems. In this talk, I will argue that RE methods should place more emphasis on these human values so we do a better job of building software that aligns with our individual, corporate or societal values. Furthermore, drawing on recent evidence from case studies in industry, I will argue that dealing with human values in software systems is not just of interest to a small group of organisations; rather, all software projects should think about human values, build them in where appropriate, test for them, and use them to drive design decisions. When they are not dealt with in this way, there can be severe social and economic consequences.",10.1109/RE.2019.00011,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920590,,6,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Can a Conversation Paint a Picture? Mining Requirements In Software Forums,,"University of Auckland, New Zealand; University of Auckland, New Zealand; University of Auckland, New Zealand; University of Auckland, New Zealand",05-Dec-19,"The modern software landscape is highly competitive. Software companies need to quickly fix reported bugs and release requested new features, or they risk negative reviews and reduced market share. The amount of online user feedback prevents manual analysis. Past research has investigated automated requirement mining techniques on online platforms like App Stores and Twitter, but online product forums have not been studied. In this paper, we show that online product forums are a rich source of user feedback that may be used to elicit product requirements. The information contained in forum questions is different from what has been described in the related work on App Stores or Twitter. Users often provide detailed context to specific problems they encounter with a software product and other users respond with workarounds or to confirm the problem. Through the analysis of two large forums, we identify 18 different types of information (classifications) contained in forums that can be relevant to maintenance and evolution tasks. We show that a state-of-the-art App Store tool is unable to accurately classify forum data, which may be due to the differences in content. Thus, specific techniques are likely needed to mine requirements from product forums. In an exploratory study, we developed classifiers with forum specific features.

Optimizing for Recall in Automatic Requirements Classification: An Empirical Study,,"Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany",05-Dec-19,"Using Machine Learning to solve requirements engineering problems can be a tricky task. Even though certain algorithms have exceptional performance, their recall is usually below 100%. One key aspect in the implementation of machine learning tools is the balance between recall and precision. Tools that do not find all correct answers may be considered useless. However, some tasks are very complicated and even requirements engineers struggle to solve them perfectly. If a tool achieves performance comparable to a trained engineer while reducing her workload considerably, it is considered to be useful. One such task is the classification of specification content elements into requirements and non-requirements. In this paper, we analyze this specific requirements classification problem and assess the importance of recall by performing an empirical study. We compared two groups of students who performed this task with and without tool support, respectively. We use the results to compute an estimate of β for the Fβ score, allowing us to choose the optimal balance between precision and recall. Furthermore, we use the results to assess the practical time savings realized by the approach. By using the tool, users may not be able to find all defects in a document, however, they will be able to find close to all of them in a fraction of the time necessary.

In principle, by following suitable writing and markup conventions, one can provide an immediate and unequivocal demarcation of requirements at the time a specification is being developed. However, neither the presence nor a fully accurate enforcement of such conventions is guaranteed. The result is that, in many practical situations, analysts end up resorting to after-the-fact reviews for sifting requirements from other material in a requirements specification. This is both tedious and time-consuming. We propose an automated approach for demarcating requirements in free-form requirements specifications. The approach, which is based on machine learning, can be applied to a wide variety of specifications in different domains and with different writing styles. We train and evaluate our approach over an independently labeled dataset comprised of 30 industrial requirements specifications.

Analysis of Requirements-Related Arguments in User Forums,,"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China",05-Dec-19,"In the past, users were asked to express their needs and intentions by writing a structured requirements document in natural language. Due to the pervasive use of online forums and social media, user feedback is more accessible today. However, the information obtained is often fragmented, involving multipleperspectives from multiple parties on an on-going basis. In this paper, we propose a Crowd-based Requirements Engineering approach by Argumentation (CrowdRE-Arg), which analyses the conversations from user forum, identifies the arguments in favor or opposing of a given requirements related discussion topic. By generating the argumentation model of the involved user statements, we are able to recover the conflicting viewpoints, to reason about the winning arguments for informed requirements decisions. The proposed approach is illustrated with a data set of sample conversations about the design of a new Google-Map feature from Reddit.

Nevertheless, we continue to see an alarmingly increasing trend in the cost and consequences of software failure. In an attempt to mitigate such loss and address software issues at a much earlier stage, researchers have recently emphasized on the successful coordination of requirements engineering and testing. In addition, the notion of requirements-based testing (RBT) has also emerged with a focus on checking the correctness, completeness, unambiguity, and logical consistency of requirements. One seminal work points out that requirements reside in the environment which is comprised of certain problem domain phenomena. Environmental assertions, which connect some of these phenomena in the indicative mood, play a key role in deciding whether a software solution is acceptable. Despite that requirements are located in the environment, little is known about if and how the environment assertions would impact testing and QA activities. In order to address this gap, we present a detailed empirical study, with 114 developers, on the prominence of environment assertions in RBT. Although the results suggest that paying attention to correct, complete, and useful environment assertions has a positive impact on RBT, developers often face difficulty in formulating good assertions from scratch.

Some of them result in overall project failure due to incorrect or missing quality characteristics such as security. There are several concerns that make security difficult to deal with; for instance, (1) when stakeholders discuss general requirements in meetings, they are often unaware that they should also discuss security-related topics, and (2) they typically do not have enough expertise in security. This often leads to unspecified or ill-defined security-related aspects. These concerns become even more challenging in agile contexts, where lightweight documentation is typically involved. The goal of this paper is to design and evaluate an approach for reviewing security-related aspects in agile requirements specifications of web applications. The approach considers user stories and security specifications as input and relates those user stories to security properties via Natural Language Processing. Based on the related security properties, our approach then identifies high-level security requirements from the Open Web Application Security Project to be verified and generates a reading technique to support reviewers in detecting defects. We evaluate our approach via two controlled experiment trials. We compare the effectiveness and efficiency of novice inspectors verifying security aspects in agile requirements using our approach against using the complete list of high-level security requirements. The (statistically significant) results indicate that using our approach has a positive impact (with large effect size) on the performance of inspectors in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",10.1109/RE.2019.00020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920644,agile requirements;requirements verification;software inspection;software security,6,IEEE Conferences,,H.

Detecting Bad Smells in Use Case Descriptions,,"Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan; Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan; Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan",05-Dec-19,"Use case modeling is very popular to represent the functionality of the system to be developed, and it consists of two parts: use case diagram and use case description. Use case descriptions are written in structured natural language (NL), and the usage of NL can lead to poor descriptions such as ambiguous, inconsistent and/or incomplete descriptions, etc. Poor descriptions lead to missing requirements and eliciting incorrect requirements as well as less comprehensiveness of produced use case models. This paper proposes a technique to automate detecting bad smells of use case descriptions, symptoms of poor descriptions. At first, to clarify bad smells, we analyzed existing use case models to discover poor use case descriptions concretely and developed the list of bad smells, i.e., a catalogue of bad smells. Some of the bad smells can be refined into measures using the Goal-Question-Metric paradigm to automate their detection. The main contribution of this paper is the automated detection of bad smells. We have implemented an automated smell detector for 22 bad smells at first and assessed its usefulness by an experiment.

Business users are rarely experts in information visualization, and they may not exactly know the most adequate visualization tools or patterns for their goals. Consequently, misinterpreted graphs and wrong results can be obtained, leading to missed opportunities and significant losses for companies. The main problem underneath is a lack of tools and methodologies that allow non-expert users to define their visualization and data analysis goals in business terms.

Extracting and Analyzing Context Information in User-Support Conversations on Twitter,,"University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",05-Dec-19,"While many apps include built-in options to report bugs or request features, users still provide an increasing amount of feedback via social media, like Twitter. Compared to traditional issue trackers, the reporting process in social media is unstructured and the feedback often lacks basic context information, such as the app version or the device concerned when experiencing the issue. To make this feedback actionable to developers, support teams engage in recurring, effortful conversations with app users to clarify missing context items. This paper introduces a simple approach that accurately extracts basic context information from unstructured, informal user feedback on mobile apps, including the platform, device, app version, and system version. Evaluated against a truthset of 3014 tweets from official Twitter support accounts of the 3 popular apps Netflix, Snapchat, and Spotify, our approach achieved precisions from 81% to 99% and recalls from 86% to 98% for the different context item types.

Requirements Classification with Interpretable Machine Learning and Dependency Parsing,,"Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Bogaziçi University, Istanbul, Turkey; Bogaziçi University, Istanbul, Turkey",05-Dec-19,"Requirements classification is a traditional application of machine learning (ML) to RE that helps handle large requirements datasets. A prime example of an RE classification problem is the distinction between functional and non-functional (quality) requirements. State-of-the-art classifiers build their effectiveness on a large set of word features like text n-grams or POS n-grams, which do not fully capture the essence of a requirement. As a result, it is arduous for human analysts to interpret the classification results by exploring the classifier's inner workings. We propose the use of more general linguistic features, such as dependency types, for the construction of interpretable ML classifiers for RE. Through a feature engineering effort, in which we are assisted by modern introspection tools that reveal the hidden inner workings of ML classifiers, we derive a set of 17 linguistic features. While classifiers that use our proposed features fit the training set slightly worse than those that use high-dimensional feature sets, our approach performs generally better on validation datasets and it is more interpretable.",10.1109/RE.2019.00025,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920401,requirements engineering;interpretable machine learning;requirements classification;explainable AI,36,IEEE Conferences,,F.

Requirements Reference Models Revisited: Accommodating Hierarchy in System Design,,"Honeywell Aerospace, Plymouth, MN, USA; University of Minnesota, Minnesota, MN, USA; University of Minnesota, Minnesota, MN, USA",05-Dec-19,"Reference models such as Parnas' four-variable model, Jackson's and Zaves' world machine model, and Gunther et al.'s WRSPM model abstractly define and relate key artifacts in requirements engineering. Such reference models are intended to serve as a frame of reference for engineers to understand and reason about the artifacts involved in requirements engineering. However, when discussing the requirements of modern systems that are developed in a hierarchical and middle-out manner, these reference models do not provide a framework in which the relationship between requirements and architecture is explicitly discussed. Conceptual clarity about this relationship is crucial since the architecture and requirements for such systems become intrinsically intertwined as the architectural choices made during development influence the requirements and vice-versa. Hence, to precisely determine the scope of specifying requirements, distinguish requirements from architecture details, reason about the requirements, and determine how the requirements are realized in the system, we argue that a requirements reference model intended as a reference for such systems must explicitly discuss the architecture - requirements relationship. To that end, we define a hierarchical reference model that formally, yet abstractly, captures the intertwined relationship between the architecture and requirements in a way that will serve the same purpose as other models, but be more suitable for modern systems where architecture and requirements co-evolve. To illustrate the concepts in this model, we use a generic patient-controlled analgesic infusion pump system as a case example.",10.1109/RE.2019.00028,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920675,requirements;reference model;twin peaks,2,IEEE Conferences,,A.

To implement the requested features, developers have to perform necessary modifications (refactorings) to prepare for new adaptation that accommodates the new requirements. Software refactoring is a well-known technique that has been extensively used to improve software quality such as maintainability and extensibility. However, it is often challenging to determine which kind of refactorings should be applied. Consequently, several approaches based on various heuristics have been proposed to recommend refactorings. However, there is still lack of automated support to recommend refactorings given a feature request. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that recommends refactorings based on the history of the previously requested features and applied refactorings. First, we exploit the stateof-the-art refactoring detection tools to identify the previous refactorings applied to implement the past feature requests. Second, we train a machine classifier with the history data of the feature requests and refactorings applied on the commits that implemented the corresponding feature requests. The machine classifier is then used to predict refactorings for new feature requests.

They can be considered domain-specific, in the sense that all modeling methods provide a knowledge schema for some selected application domain (narrow or broad). Besides this inherent domain-specific nature, we are investigating how the characteristics of modeling methods inform the RE perspective, and how in turn RE can support the engineering of such artifacts. Thus, the work at hand aims to raise awareness about modeling method requirements in the RE community. The core contribution is the CoChaCo (Concept-Characteristic-Connector) method for the representation and management of such requirements, as well as for streamlining with subsequent engineering phases. CoChaCo is itself a modeling method - i.e., it achieves its goals through diagrammatic modeling means for which a supporting tool was prototyped and evolved.

Extraction of System States from Natural Language Requirements,,"Technische Universität Berlin, Germany; Technische Universität Berlin, Germany; Technische Universität Berlin, Germany",05-Dec-19,"In recent years, simulations have proven to be an important means to verify the behavior of complex software systems. The different states of a system are monitored in the simulations and are compared against the requirements specification. So far, system states in natural language requirements cannot be automatically linked to signals from the simulation. However, the manual mapping between requirements and simulation is a time-consuming task. Named-entity Recognition is a sub-task from the field of automated information retrieval and is used to classify parts of natural language texts into categories. In this paper, we use a self-trained Named-entity Recognition model with Bidirectional LSTMs and CNNs to extract states from requirements specifications. We present an almost entirely automated approach and an iterative semi-automated approach to train our model. The automated and iterative approach are compared and discussed with respect to the usual manual extraction. We show that the manual extraction of states in 2,000 requirements takes nine hours.

Their ubiquitous presence makes users more dependent on them and their correctness in many aspects of daily life. Thus, there is a rising need to make software systems and their decisions more comprehensible. This seems to call for more transparency in software-supported decisions. Therefore, transparency is gaining importance as a non-functional requirement. However, the abstract quality aspect of transparency needs to be better understood and related to mechanisms that can foster it. Integrating explanations in software to leverage systems' opacity has been discussed often. Yet, an important first step is to understand user requirements with respect to explainable software behavior: Are users really interested in transparency, and are explanations considered an adequate mechanism to achieve it? We conducted a survey with 107 end-users to assess their opinion on the current status of transparency in software systems, and what they consider main advantages and disadvantages of explanations embedded in software. The overall attitude towards embedded explanations was positive. However, we also identified potential disadvantages.

The most rigorous techniques for real-time requirement analysis depend on the formalisation of these requirements. Completely formalised real-time requirements allow the detection of issues that are hard to find through other means, like real-time inconsistency (i.e., ""do the requirements lead to deadlocks and starvation of the system?"") or vacuity (i.e., ""are some requirements trivially satisfied""). Current analysis techniques for real-time requirements suffer from scalability issues - larger sets of such requirements are usually intractable. We present a new technique to analyse formalised real-time requirements for various properties.

Arithmetic Semantics of Feature and Goal Models for Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems,,"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa Ottawa, Ontario, Canada",05-Dec-19,"Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) today are self-adaptive, in order to handle frequent changes in environmental conditions and requirements. In CPSs, goal-based reasoning is often used to include stakeholder and social concerns in decision making during design and runtime adaptation activities. To better support some of these activities, arithmetic semantics for goal models were proposed to enable the generation of mathematical functions usable by systems. However, goal models often allow invalid combinations of alternatives, which can be prevented by companion feature models. In this paper, to enable the generation of valid and optimal configurations for adaptive CPSs, we propose new arithmetic semantics for feature models that enable their transformations to mathematical functions (in several programming languages) further restricting the ones generated from goal models. The composition of feature and goal functions results in a smaller design space, leading to fewer but valid solutions that can be generated (e.g., through optimization) and used in simulations and running adaptive CPSs with social concerns. Finally, a simulation model in SysML is proposed in this paper to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of this composition.",10.1109/RE.2019.00034,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920481,"CPS, Feature Model, Formalization, Goal Model, Goal based Reasoning, Self Adaptation, Simulation, SysML",11,IEEE Conferences,,A.

Despite of the regulation's legal, political, and technological ramifications, relatively little research has been carried out for better understanding the GDPR's practical implications for requirements engineering and software architectures. Building on a grounded theory approach with close ties to the Finnish software industry, this paper contributes to the sealing of this gap in previous research. Three questions are asked and answered in the context of software development organizations. First, the paper elaborates nine practical constraints under which many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often operate when implementing solutions that address the new regulatory demands. Second, the paper elicits nine regulatory requirements from the GDPR for software architectures. Third, the paper presents an implementation for a software architecture that complies both with the requirements elicited and the constraints elaborated.",10.1109/RE.2019.00036,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920529,"Data protection, privacy, requirements engineering, software architectures, regulation, law, GDPR, SMEs, SOA",14,IEEE Conferences,,K.

Requirements Engineering Method for Infrastructure Automation and Cloud Projects,,"Netcloud AG, Winterthur, Switzerland",05-Dec-19,"Digitalization is progressing at a rapid pace worldwide. This also has a direct impact on Netcloud and its customers. In order to provide services faster and more flexible, automation tools and cloud solutions are used to support the IT. The company Net-cloud has, therefore, set up a selected team that mainly takes care of automation projects for customers and supports them in their implementation. Since these projects are always new, resource-intensive and innovative, the planning and implementation of automation projects are very demanding. This leads to problems and challenges in requirements engineering. An extensive literature review has shown that there are numer-ous cloud computing frameworks and methods, but none that take the view of the service provider and consider the implemen-tation respectively. This paper closes this gap by developing a new requirements engineering methodology for automation and cloud projects. After an evaluation, the most suitable requirements elicitation techniques were combined in an iterative method. This method is characterized by the fact that the iterations and the mix of elicita-tion techniques (i.e. interview, workshop, survey and reuse) re-peatedly check the requirements for being up-to-date, complete, and feasible. This allows a step-by-step approach for the devel-opment of the desired product or service.",10.1109/RE.2019.00037,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920425,"requirements, automation, cloud computing, requirements elicitation",,IEEE Conferences,,A.

In this paper we take a look at the constraints and requirements for delivering a training, by means of cybersecurity challenges, that covers secure coding topics from an industry perspective. Using requirements engineering, we aim at understanding the design requirements for such challenges. Along the way, we give details on our experience of delivering cybersecurity challenges in an industrial setting and show the outcome and lessons learned.

Big Data Analytics on Cyber Attack Graphs for Prioritizing Agile Security Requirements,,"Accenture Labs, Accenture; Accenture Labs, Accenture",05-Dec-19,"In enterprise environments, the amount of managed assets and vulnerabilities that can be exploited is staggering. Hackers' lateral movements between such assets generate a complex big data graph, that contains potential hacking paths.

Agile Security models different types of security requirements into the context of an attack graph, containing business process targets and critical assets identification, configuration items, and possible impacts of cyber-attacks. By simulating and analyzing virtual adversary attack paths toward cardinal assets, Agile Security examines the business impact on business processes and prioritizes surgical requirements. Thus, handling these requirements backlog that are constantly evaluated as an outcome of employing Agile Security, gradually increases system hardening, reduces business risks and informs the IT service desk or Security Operation Center what remediation action to perform next.

Gender and User Feedback: An Exploratory Study,,"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento",05-Dec-19,"Through app stores, users can submit feedback in the form of user reviews. Previous work has found that these reviews contain useful information such as user requirements and bug reports; and has presented approaches for automatically extracting this information.

In this paper, we take a step in this direction and report on an exploratory study that investigates 919 reviews from eight countries written by users with usernames identified by manual analysis as female or male. We contribute initial evidence of a possible imbalance in the number of female and males users writing app reviews. Additionally, while this disproportion exists, the analyzed feedback between female and male users is similar in terms of the expressed sentiment, content, rating, timing and length. These variables are commonly used when prioritizing user feedback for their later use during software evolution.

Non-Functional Requirements for Machine Learning: Challenges and New Directions,,Chalmers and the University of Gothenburg,05-Dec-19,"Machine Learning (ML) provides approaches which use big data to enable algorithms to ""learn"", producing outputs which would be difficult to obtain otherwise. Despite the advances allowed by ML, much recent attention has been paid to certain qualities of ML solutions, particularly fairness and transparency, but also qualities such as privacy, security, and testability. From a requirements engineering (RE) perspective, such qualities are also known as non-functional requirements (NFRs). In RE, the meaning of certain NFRs, how to refine those NFRs, and how to use NFRs for design and runtime decision making over traditional software is relatively well established and understood. However, in a context where the solution involves ML, much of our knowledge about NFRs no longer applies. First, the types of NFRs we are concerned with undergo a shift: NFRs like fairness and transparency become prominent, whereas other NFRs such as modularity may become less relevant. The meanings and interpretations of NFRs in an ML context (e.g., maintainability, interoperability, and usability) must be rethought, including how these qualities are decomposed into sub-qualities. Trade-offs between NFRs in an ML context must be re-examined. Beyond the changing landscape of NFRs, we can ask if our known approaches to understanding, formalizing, modeling, and reasoning over NFRs at design and runtime must also be adjusted, or can be applied as-is to this new area? Given these questions, this work outlines challenges and a proposed research agenda for the exploration of NFRs for ML-based solutions.",10.1109/RE.2019.00050,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920538,"Non-Functional Requirements, NFRs, qualities, Machine Learning, Requirements Engineering",52,IEEE Conferences,,J.

This applies to the creation of new digital ecosystems, where players with services and data are on boarded on newly established platforms, as well as to the evolution of existing ecosystems. Since these RE-relevant dimensions have not been investigated systematically yet, we performed an interview series with practitioners and scientists working on actual digital ecosystems. We collected a set of 61 information needs, i.e., aspects that are relevant when making decisions on requirements.

Data-Driven Elicitation and Optimization of Dependencies between Requirements,,"University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada; University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada; University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada",05-Dec-19,"Requirement dependencies affect many activities in the software development life cycle such as design, implementation, testing, release planning and change management. They are the basis for various software development decisions. However, requirements dependencies extraction is not only error-prone but also a cognitively and computationally complex problem that consumes substantial efforts, since most of the requirements are documented in natural language. This paper proposes a novel approach to extracts requirements dependencies utilizing natural-language processing (NLP) and weakly supervised learning (WSL) in two stages. In the first stage, binary dependencies (basic dependencies:dependent/independent) are identified, which are further analyzed to detect the type of the dependency in the second stage. An initial evaluation of this approach on the PURE data set - European Rail Traffic Management System - was carried out using three machine learners (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Naïve Bayes), which were then compared and tested. Results showed that all the three learners exhibited similar accuracy measures, while SVM needed additional parameter tuning. The machine learners' accuracy was further improved by applying weakly supervised learning to generate pseudo annotations for unlabelled data.

In addition, companies are moving toward new business models, in which products and services are offered without charge to users, but in exchange for targeted advertising revenue. New privacy regulations require organizations to explicitly state their data practices in privacy policies, including which data types will be collected. By consenting to data collections described in a policy, the user acknowledges that he or she is granting the company the authorizations needed to access their data. When data practices change, a new version of the policy is released. This release can occur a few times a year, when requirements are rapidly changing for the collection and processing of personal data. Furthermore, the user may change his or her privacy consent by opting in or out of the policy. We propose a formal framework to support companies and users in their understanding of policies evolution under consent regime that supports both retroactive and non-retroactive consent and consent revocation.

Requirement Mining in Software Product Forums,,"University of Auckland, Auckland",05-Dec-19,"The majority of software projects fail, around 71% according to recent research. A shortage of user feedback and missed requirements are cited as primary reasons for failure. There are several prominent online platforms where software users post product feedback, including: app stores, Twitter, issue trackers and product forums. I have identified the study of product forums as a gap in the current requirement mining literature, and have selected them as the focus of this research. Product forums are widely used in the software industry, supporting online discussions between a products users and owners. While their primary function is to help customers use the product, forums are also a rich source of untapped user generated requirements. However, the manual effort to extract these requirements is prohibitively time consuming due to their large volume and inconsistent quality. Analysis tools to assist in requirement mining have been applied successfully to online platforms previously, but as of yet, not in the forum domain, where current techniques may be insufficient. My preliminary research has found that forums contain feedback useful for software maintenance and evolution, including several categories of feedback not identified in the current literature. I have developed forum specific classifiers to help categorise the different feedback in forum posts. I demonstrate that these classifiers significantly outperform a leading app store tool when applied to forums. In this report I present my preliminary findings, then outline my research plan with the final goal of producing an industry evaluated, forum analysis tool.",10.1109/RE.2019.00057,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920680,Software product forums;Machine learning;Natural language processing,4,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Behaviour-Driven Requirements Engineering for Agile Product Line Engineering,,"Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt",05-Dec-19,"Due to the need of the software development community to integrate the flexibility and the high responsiveness of agile software development with the economic advantages, of reuse and mass customisation, offered by product lines, agile product line engineering has been gaining a momentum of attention from both researchers and practitioners. Developing and managing the different requirements engineering phases of product lines present is a dilemma that the efforts done in the literature was not able to effectively and efficiently resolve. To realise the full potential of agile product line engineering in practice, a complete, consistent, correct, and unambiguous user requirements must be produced without investing that huge amount of time in the upfront domain engineering phase of a traditional software product line. In this proposal, a behaviour-driven cloud-based framework is introduced to develop and maintain software product lines in an agile-based environment. The approach relies on upfront automated testing to derive and manage core assets and variations of an agile-based software product line. The model is validated through an empirical study and the preliminary results are very promising.",10.1109/RE.2019.00058,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920618,agile product line engineering;requirements engineering;behaviour-driven development;cloud computing;empirical study,2,IEEE Conferences,,H.

Mining Requirements Arguments from user Forums,,"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China",05-Dec-19,"In order to sustain, software systems have to evolve in favor of its main target users. Due to the pervasive adoption of online user forums and social media, collecting users feedbacks and comments become possible. However, such crowd generated data are often fragmented, with various viewpoints mentioned during a series of message exchange. The aim of the thesis is to propose an argumentation-based CrowdRE approach, which represents such group conversations as a user argumentation model with the original conversation structure reserved. Based on the argumentation model, we are able to identify new features proposed by the crowd-users or issues encountered, and their supporting and attacking arguments using argumentation theory. To accomplish this research, we adopted an abstract argumentation, bipolar argumentation framework, and coalition-based meta argumentation framework. In addition, to provided automated support to our proposed approach, algorithms will be developed for bipolar argumentation, coalition-based meta argumentation, and end-users voting mechanism. Finally, this thesis employees different machine learning algorithms to automatically classify crowd-users comments into rationale elements and identify conflict-free features or claims based on their supporting and attacking arguments.

Towards Human Values Traceability in Software: A Goal Modeling Approach,,"Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia",05-Dec-19,"Software has become an integral part of human life and while Software Engineering (SE) is aware of the values of security or privacy that relate to software quality, to date it is unable to account for the majority of the other human values (e.g., social justice, trust, freedom). Engineering human values into software is now emerging as an area of study but requires theoretical and methodological support from SE research and practice. A part of the challenge of integrating human values into software is related to tracing human values throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). However, the number of studies in the domain of Human Values and SE is very limited. Moreover, there has been no previous study or practice performed on Human Values Traceability in SE. Therefore, this research study examines existing techniques and their applicability to trace human values in software. First, we explore the existing techniques that have the potential to trace human values in software. This exploration is extended from SE to other related domains such as Requirement Engineering, Software Design, Values in Design and Software Traceability. Identified techniques are then evaluated to identify the extent to which they can be used to trace human values in different phases of the SDLC. Our preliminary results found goal modeling and goal-centric traceability as promising techniques to initiate human values traceability in software. Therefore, we apply goal modeling to a case study to explore the ways this technique can be used and potentially improved to trace human values. Further, the improved technique will be evaluated through another case study.",10.1109/RE.2019.00060,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920551,Human Values;Traceability;Goal Modeling,4,IEEE Conferences,,H.

Designing a Conversational Requirements Elicitation System for End-Users,,"Institute of Information Systems and Marketing (IISM), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany",05-Dec-19,"Context: Digital transformation impacts an ever-increasing degree of everyone's business and private life. It is imperative to incorporate a wide audience of user requirements in the development process to design successful information systems (IS). Hence, requirements elicitation (RE) is increasingly performed by end-users that are novices at contributing requirements to IS development projects. Objective: We need to develop RE systems that are capable of assisting a wide audience of end-users in communicating their needs and requirements. Prominent methods, such as elicitation interviews, are challenging to apply in such a context, as time and location constraints limit potential audiences. Research Method: The presented dissertation project utilizes design science research to develop a requirements self-elicitation system, LadderBot. A conversational agent (CA) enables end-users to articulate needs and requirements on the grounds of the laddering method. The CA mimics a human interviewer's capability to rephrase questions and provide assistance in the process and allows users to converse in their natural language. Furthermore, the tool will assist requirements analysts with the subsequent aggregation and analysis of collected data. Contribution: The dissertation project makes a practical contribution in the form of a ready-to-use system for wide audience end-user RE and subsequent analysis utilizing laddering as cognitive elicitation technique. A theoretical contribution is provided by developing a design theory for the application of conversational agents for RE, including the laboratory and field evaluation of design principles.",10.1109/RE.2019.00061,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920648,End user;Wide Audience;Requirements Elicitation;Conversational Agent;Design Science;Laddering,2,IEEE Conferences,,T.

An Approach to Design Trust-Aware Goal Model and Provenance Model for Intelligent Adaptive Systems,,"Department of Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea",05-Dec-19,"Intelligent Adaptive System is a proactive and flexible system that provides appropriate services to a user based on current situation. For the adaptation, a single system may not have enough capability to collect all required information, and as a result it needs to cooperate with other systems. One of the most important things in the cooperation is determining a reliable partner, because an unreliable cooperation may cause critical problems such as information hijacking or personal information extrusion. Trust can be one of the key solutions as the emerging quality attribute which is appropriate to the cooperation in the connected environments. In this research, we propose trust-aware requirements engineering framework with prove -nance model as new trust evidence. Based on the understanding about trust, we propose a method to define the trust-requiring situation and derive the trust-aware goal model in the requirements engineering process. Comparing to the traditional goal model, the trust-aware goal model can represent the trust-related requirements. It helps system engineer to analyze and develop the trust-aware system. In addition, we also need to analyze which information can represent and evaluate trust. Because the existing works cannot represent the various facets about trust, we suggest provenance model as the new trust evidence. Provenance model is the information about the history, derivation, origin, or context of a specific artifact. It can be used as the trust evidence, because the trust can be determined by the reputations from the historical contexts of the system.",10.1109/RE.2019.00062,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920699,Requirement Engineering;Trust;Goal Modeling;Provenance,,IEEE Conferences,,L.

This development methodology is attracting attention because it can develop software that operates quickly despite uncertain situations and limited information (requirements), and it can adaptively develop while checking feedback both frequently and regularly. The key is to welcome change without resistance, which is not limited to development but also requires changes in requirement management. However, there is a lack of practical guidance on how to manage changes in agile requirements engineering. Although we need to consider all areas of requirements engineering, the author has seen three key themes: (1) How to focus on customer value and represent it clearly for smooth communication between teams in a large enterprise? (2) What are the requirements for organizing elements that make it easy to accept changes and assess impacts? (3) What reasonable algorithm is easy to use and reliable to prioritize or reorder requirements based on values regularly? The author wants to suggest practical ways to address these themes and propose a way to deal with three themes without compromising on the essence of agile.

Mitigating Challenges in the Elicitation and Analysis of Transparency Requirements,,"Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany",05-Dec-19,"Software systems are getting more and more complex, with an increasing integration of machine-learning based decisions. The ubiquitous presence of these systems makes users more dependent on them and their correctness in many aspects of daily life. Thus, there is a rising need to make software systems and their decisions more comprehensible. This seems to call for more transparency in software-supported decisions. Therefore, transparency requirements have to be understood, elicited and translated to lower level requirements. However, there is a lack of understanding about the requirements engineering process for transparency and how the different roles, e.g., UX designers, data scientists, and other stakeholders, have to interact in this process. In order to fill this gap, the requirements engineering process for transparency requirements needs to be thoroughly investigated. For this purpose, I intend to conduct empirical studies with practitioners and other stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of the process and its associated problems.

Handling Socio-Technical Barriers Involved in Crowd-Based Requirements Elicitation,,"Department of Computer Science & Software Engineering, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan",05-Dec-19,"Currently a large number of software systems target a huge customer base termed as market-driven or market-based systems. Requirements elicitation of such a kind of software systems is not possible following a traditional approach as there are many geo-graphically dispersed customers in these systems. These days crowd-based requirements elicitation (CBRE) has been proposed and utilized by researchers and practitioners as a new method of requirements identification which offers benefits of handling many diverse system's stakeholders. CBRE is done by involving crowd members through crowdsourcing. This method in turn involves many social and technical barriers, as the participants (crowd) utilized during this process belong to varying geographic regions with varying cultures and diversity, and due to the in-volvement of crowdsourcing platform during elicitation process. The objective of this PhD research proposal is to identify these socio-technical barriers involved in crowd-based requirements and devising a requirements elicitation strategy to better handle the issues involved in CBRE. An exploratory case study methodology will be utilized to explore the socio-technical barriers, the root causes as well as pros and cons of these barriers. Based on the exploratory case study results, a strategy will be devised for requirements elicitation, involving crowd participants. While, a confirmatory case study will be conducted to check the effectiveness of this strategy.

Specifying Requirements through Interaction Design,,"Institute of Computer Technology, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria",05-Dec-19,"When the requirements and the interaction design of a system are separated, they will most likely not fit together, and the resulting system will be less than optimal. Even if all the real needs are covered in the requirements and also implemented, errors may be induced by human-computer interaction through a bad interaction design and its resulting user interface. Such a system may even not be used at all. Alternatively, a great user interface of a system with features that are not required will not be very useful as well. This tutorial explains joint modeling of (communicative) interaction design and requirements, through discourse models and ontologies. Our discourse models are derived from results of human communication theories, cognitive science and sociology (even without employing speech or natural language). While these models were originally devised for capturing interaction design, it turned out that they can be also viewed as specifying classes of scenarios, i.e., use cases. In this sense, they can also be utilized for specifying requirements. Ontologies are used to define domain models and the domains of discourse for the interactions with software systems. User interfaces for these software systems can be generated semi-automatically from our discourse models, domain-of-discourse models and specifications of the requirements. This is especially useful when user interfaces for different devices are needed. Specific usability requirements can be dealt with in our approach through advanced customization approaches. Hence, inter-action design facilitates requirements engineering to make applications both more useful and usable.",10.1109/RE.2019.00078,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920541,"requirements, interaction design, automatic GUI tailoring, (semi-)automatic GUI generation",,IEEE Conferences,,H.

Towards an Ontology of Requirements Engineering Approaches,,"Independent Requirements Specialist, Derby, UK; Laing O'Rourke, Worksop, UK; Chalmers, Sweden LUT, Finland; University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield, UK",05-Dec-19,"Requirements are a key factor in determining the success or failure of the system development process. Requirements engineering is a creative problem-solving process whose primary purpose is to enable researchers and practitioners to apply appropriate theories, models, techniques and tools to understand and support the requirements processes more effectively. However, there is a multitude of ways to conduct the requirements engineering process and the quality of the requirements can be greatly influenced by the approaches employed. While consensus exists that no one approach works in all situations, how do practitioners and researchers select the most relevant and appropriate approach(es)? In order to understand this, we argue that a community-based effort is required to organise the plethora of requirements engineering approaches into an ontology. Such a structure would provide an opportunity to identify gaps and to improve the interfaces between approaches.

The Next Release Problem Revisited: A New Avenue for Goal Models,,"Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands; Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands; Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands; University of Trento, Trento, Italy; University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada",14-Oct-18,"Context. Goal models have long been critiqued for the time it takes to construct them as well as for their limited cognitive and visual scalability. Is such criticism general or does it depend on the supported task? Objectives. We advocate for the latter and the aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the next release problem is a suitable application domain for goal models. This hypothesis stems from the fact that product release management is a long-term investment, and software products are commonly managed in ""themes"" which are smaller focus areas of the product. Methods. We employ a version of goal models that is tailored for the next release problem by capturing requirements, synergies among them, constraints, and release objectives. Such goal model allows discovering optimal solutions considering multiple criteria for the next release. Results. A retrospective case study confirms that goal models are easier to read and comprehend when organized in themes, and that the reasoning results help product managers decide for the next release. Our scalability experiments show that, through reasoning based on optimization modulo theories, the discovery of the optimal solution is fast and scales sufficiently well with respect to the model size, connectivity, and number of alternative solutions.",10.1109/RE.2018.00-56,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491119,next release problem;release planning;goal oriented requirements engineering;constrained goal models;multi-objective optimization;optimization modulo theories,6,IEEE Conferences,,F.

The Manager Perspective on Requirements Impact on Automotive Systems Development Speed,,Chalmers ! University of Gothenburg; Chalmers ! University of Gothenburg; Western Norway University - of Aoolied Sciences; Chalmers ! University of Gothenburg; NA; Knowit AB,14-Oct-18,"Context: Historically, automotive manufacturers have adopted rigid requirements engineering processes, which allowed them to meet safety-critical requirements while integrating thousands of physical and software components into a highly complex and differentiated product. Nowadays, needs of improving development speed are pushing companies in this domain towards new ways of developing software. Objectives: We aim at obtaining a manager perspective on how the goal to increase development speed impacts how software intense automotive systems are developed and their requirements managed. Methods: We used a qualitative multiple-case study, based on 20 semi-structured interviews, at two automotive manufacturers. Our sampling strategy focuses on manager roles, complemented with technical specialists. Results: We found that both a requirements style dominated by safety concerns, and decomposition of requirements over many levels of abstraction impact development speed negatively. Furthermore, the use of requirements as part of legal contracts with suppliers hiders fast collaboration. Suggestions for potential improvements include domain-specific tooling, model-based requirements, test automation, and a combination of lightweight pre-development requirements engineering with precise specifications post-development. Conclusions: We offer an empirical account of expectations and needs for new requirements engineering approaches in the automotive domain, necessary to coordinate hundreds of collaborating organizations developing software-intensive and potentially safety-critical systems.",10.1109/RE.2018.00-55,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491120,requirements engineering;continuous software engineering;automotive systems engineering,8,IEEE Conferences,,S.

A Qualitative Study on using GuideGen to Keep Requirements and Acceptance Tests Aligned,,"Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland",14-Oct-18,"Software requirements constantly change, thus impacting all other artifacts of an evolving system. In order to keep the system in a consistent state, changes in requirements should be documented and applied accordingly to all affected artifacts, including acceptance tests. In practice, however, changes in requirements are not always documented nor applied to the affected acceptance tests. This is mostly due to poor communication, lack of time or work overload, and eventually leads to project delays, unintended costs and unsatisfied customers. GuideGen is a tool-supported approach for keeping requirements and acceptance tests aligned. When a requirement is changed, GuideGen automatically generates guidance in natural language on how to modify impacted acceptance tests and communicates this information to the concerned parties. In this paper, we evaluate GuideGen in terms of its perceived usefulness for practitioners and its applicability to real software projects. The evaluation was conducted via interviews with 23 industrial practitioners from ten companies based in Europe. The results indicate that GuideGen is a useful approach that facilitates requirements change management and the communication of changes between requirements and test engineers. The participants also identified potential for improvement, in particular for using GuideGen in large projects.",10.1109/RE.2018.00-54,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491121,Requirements and acceptance tests alignement;Requirements change management,3,IEEE Conferences,,S.

Enhancing Automated Requirements Traceability by Resolving Polysemy,,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, USA; School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, China; School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, China",14-Oct-18,"Requirements traceability provides critical support throughout all phases of software engineering. Automated tracing based on information retrieval (IR) reduces the effort required to perform a manual trace. Unfortunately, IR-based trace recovery suffers from low precision due to polysemy, which refers to the coexistence of multiple meanings for a term appearing in different requirements. Latent semantic indexing (LSI) has been introduced as a method to tackle polysemy, as well as synonymy. However, little is known about the scope and significance of polysemous terms in requirements tracing. While quantifying the effect, we present a novel method based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to enhance the capability of automatically resolving polysemous terms. The core idea is to build an ANN model which leverages a term's highest-scoring coreferences in different requirements to learn whether this term has the same meaning in those requirements. Experimental results based on 2 benchmark datasets and 6 long-lived open-source software projects show that our approach outperforms LSI on identifying polysemous terms and hence increasing the precision of automated tracing.",10.1109/RE.2018.00-53,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491122,"Requirements traceability, automated require ments tracing, polysemy analysis, term coreference",25,IEEE Conferences,,W.

Vetting Automatically Generated Trace Links: What Information is Useful to Human Analysts?,,"Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, Sweden; Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, Sweden; University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA; University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN, USA; Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, Sweden",14-Oct-18,"Automated traceability has been investigated for over a decade with promising results. However, a human analyst is needed to vet the generated trace links to ensure their quality. The process of vetting trace links is not trivial and while previous studies have analyzed the performance of the human analyst, they have not focused on the analyst's information needs. The aim of this study is to investigate what context information the human analyst needs. We used design science research, in which we conducted interviews with ten practitioners in the traceability area to understand the information needed by human analysts. We then compared the information collected from the interviews with existing literature. We created a prototype tool that presents this information to the human analyst. To further understand the role of context information, we conducted a controlled experiment with 33 participants. Our interviews reveal that human analysts need information from three different sources: 1) from the artifacts connected by the link, 2) from the traceability information model, and 3) from the tracing algorithm. The experiment results show that the content of the connected artifacts is more useful to the analyst than the contextual information of the artifacts.",10.1109/RE.2018.00-52,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491123,Requirements traceability;Automated traceability;Traceability,10,IEEE Conferences,,S.

To demonstrate the feasibility and value of such analysis, in this paper, we present a case study on the rise and fall of Yik Yak, one of the most popular social networking apps at its peak. In particular, we identify and analyze the design decisions that led to the downfall of Yik Yak and track rival apps' attempts to take advantage of this failure.

Customer Rating Reactions Can Be Predicted Purely using App Features,,"Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, UK; ",14-Oct-18,"In this paper we provide empirical evidence that the rating that an app attracts can be accurately predicted from the features it offers. Our results, based on an analysis of 11,537 apps from the Samsung Android and BlackBerry World app stores, indicate that the rating of 89% of these apps can be predicted with 100% accuracy. Our prediction model is built by using feature and rating information from the existing apps offered in the App Store and it yields highly accurate rating predictions, using only a few (11-12) existing apps for case-based prediction. These findings may have important implications for requirements engineering in app stores: They indicate that app developers may be able to obtain (very accurate) assessments of the customer reaction to their proposed feature sets (requirements), thereby providing new opportunities to support the requirements elicitation process for app developers.",10.1109/RE.2018.00018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491125,App Store Analysis;Requirements Elicitation;App Features Extraction;Rating Estimation;Mobile Applications;Software Analytics;Predictive Modelling;Natural Language Processing;Machine Learning;Case Based Reasoning,28,IEEE Conferences,,F.

Invisibility is one of these NFRs that means the ability to hide technology from users. Although invisibility is long seen as an essential characteristic for achieving the goals of UbiComp, it has not been cataloged regarding its subcharacteristics and solutions, making its design and requirements specification in such applications a challenging task. Considering the Softgoal Interdependency Graph (SIG), which is a well-known format to catalog NFRs, this work aims at capturing subcharacteristics and solutions for Invisibility and cataloging them in a SIG. Since there is no systematic approach on how to build SIGs, we also propose to systematize the definition of Invisibility SIG using the following well-defined research methods: snowballing, database search, grounded theory and questionnaires. As a result, we got an Invisibility SIG composed of two main subcharacteristics, twelve sub-subcharacteristics, ten general solutions and fifty-six specific solutions. This organized body of knowledge is useful for supporting software engineers to specify requirements and practical solutions for UbiComp and IoT applications.

Thus, many experiences have been gained and shared in the community that reflect which RE methods are suitable for a specific context, such as embedded systems development (e.g., automotive or military domain) or information systems development (e.g., banking or flight control domain). Nowadays, in times of smart cities and their counterpart smart rural areas, where newly introduced IT systems have a strong effect on our society, a new and challenging context arises for RE, which opens up new research questions. As a contribution to this situation and to foster discussions in our community about whether our RE methods are appropriate in this new ""social context"", this perspective paper reflects on the state of the art and on our own experiences in applying RE in the context of smart rural areas. These results might also pertain in the context of smart cities that pose similar challenges to RE.

Semantic Incompleteness in Privacy Policy Goals,,"Institute for Software Research, Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States; Institute for Software Research, Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States",14-Oct-18,"Companies that collect personal information online often maintain privacy policies that are required to accurately reflect their data practices and privacy goals. To be comprehensive and flexible for future practices, policies contain ambiguity that summarize practices over multiple types of products and business contexts.

Our results include 281 data action instances obtained from 202 manually annotated statements across five privacy policies. Therein, we identified 878 instances of 17 types of semantic roles. Incomplete data practice descriptions undermine user comprehension, and can affect the user's perceived privacy risk, which we measure using factorial vignette surveys.

Online feedback mechanisms enable end-users to remotely communicate problems, experiences, and opinions, while monitoring provides valuable information about runtime events. It is argued that bringing both information sources together can help requirements engineers to understand end-user needs better.

Methods: We performed a quasi-experiment comparing the standard i* concrete syntax with an alternative that has an increased semantic transparency. We asked 57 novice participants to perform understanding and reviewing tasks on i* models, and measured their accuracy, speed and ease, using metrics of task success, time and effort, collected with eye-tracking and participants' feedback. Results: We found no evidence of improved accuracy or speed attributable to the alternative concrete syntax. Although participants' perceived ease was similar, they devoted significantly less visual effort to the model and the provided language key, when using the alternative concrete syntax.

An Experimental Comparison of Two Navigation Techniques for Requirements Modeling Tools,,"Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland",14-Oct-18,"In Requirements Engineering, many modeling tasks require viewing different parts of a model concurrently. However, traditional zoom+scroll navigation uses a single focus zoom, i.e., at a given point in time, a user can zoom in on a single spot in the model only. Therefore, new focus+context navigation techniques have been proposed that allow multiple foci at the same time. In this paper, we report on an experiment with students where we compare the participants' performance when using a requirements modeling tool with traditional zoom+scroll navigation vs. one with so-called FlexiView navigation which is a focus+context technique with multiple foci. The participants had to perform typical modeling tasks such as searching, editing, and traversing a model. All tasks were performed on medium-sized tablets with a tool for manipulating so-called ImitGraphs. ImitGraphs are enriched node-and-edge diagrams that can mimic various diagram types such as class, activity, or goal decomposition diagrams.

Morse: Reducing the Feature Interaction Explosion Problem using Subject Matter Knowledge as Abstract Requirements,,"Critical Systems Labs, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Critical Systems Labs, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Critical Systems Labs, Vancouver, BC, Canada",14-Oct-18,"The feature interaction problem appears in many different kinds of complex systems, especially systems whose elements are created or maintained by separate entities - for example, a modern automobile that incorporates electronic systems produced by different suppliers. Cross-cutting concerns, such as safety and security, require a comprehensive analysis of the possible interactions. However, there is a combinatorial explosion in the number of feature combinations to be considered. Our work approaches the feature interaction problem from a novel point of view: we seek to use the abstract subject matter knowledge of domain experts to deduce why some features will NOT interact, rather than trying to discover or resolve the interactions. In this paper, we present a method that can automatically reduce the required number of combinations and situations that have to be evaluated or resolved for feature interactions. Our tool, called Morse, rules out feature combinations that cannot have interactions based on traceable deductions from relatively simple abstract requirements that capture relevant subject matter knowledge. Our method is useful as a means of focusing attention on particular situations where more detailed functional requirements may be needed to avoid unacceptable risk arising from unintended interactions between features. relatively simple abstract requirements that capture relevant subject matter knowledge.

In this paper we address the specific problems of discovering, analyzing, specifying, and managing safety requirements within the agile Scrum process.

Despite this popularity, empirical studies have reported several challenges that large-scale distributed agile projects face regarding the implementation of quality requirements. However, there is little known about the mechanisms behind those challenges and the practices currently used by agile practitioners to adequately assure the implementation of quality requirements in distributed context. To look deeper into this, we performed a qualitative multi-case study in six different organizations in the Netherlands. Our multi-case study included seventeen semi-structured open-ended in-depth interviews with agile practitioners of different background and expertise. The analysis of the collected data re-sulted in identifying eleven mechanisms that could be associated with the previously published list of challenges.

Common problems include ambiguity in statements, specifications at the wrong level of abstraction, statements with inconsistent references to types, conflicting requirements, and incomplete requirements. These pitfalls lead to errors being introduced early in the design process. The longer the gap between error introduction and error discovery, the higher the cost associated with the error. To address the growing cost of system development, we introduce a tool called ASSERT"" (Analysis of Semantic Specifications and Efficient generation of Requirements-based Tests) for capturing requirements, backed by a formal requirements analysis engine. ASSERT"" also automatically generates a complete set of requirements-based test cases. Capturing requirements in an unambiguous way and then formally analyzing them with an automated theorem prover eliminates errors as soon as requirements are written. It also addresses the historical problem that analysis engines are hard to use for someone without formal methods expertise and analysis results are often difficult for the end-user to understand and make actionable.

Diagnosis is particularly challenging in SoS due to their technological heterogeneity and the diversity of development tools in use.

UX has various characteristics of differing importance; it can be difficult for RE engineers to grasp all characteristics of UX and to judge which characteristics are important and which need to be improved. We propose a two-step approach to solve these difficulties. The first step is the definition of a UX quality model and corresponding metrics. We propose an approach to calculate the UX score of a business application using the value of these metrics. The second step is a process to identify insufficient characteristics within the calculated UX score.

We propose a refinement calculus for requirements engineering (CaRE) for solving this problem, which takes into account the typically dialectic nature of requirements activities. The calculus casts the requirement problem as an iterative argument between stakeholders and requirements engineers, where posited requirements are attacked for being ambiguous, incomplete, etc. and refined into new requirements that address the defect pointed out by the attack. Refinements are carried out by operators provided by CaRE that refine (e.g., strengthen, weaken, decompose) existing requirements, to build a refinement graph.

Reflection on Evolutionary Decision Making with Goal Modeling Via Empirical Studies,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada",14-Oct-18,"Goal models have long been used in academia without wide spread adoption in industry. If the fundamental purpose of goal models is to allow stakeholders to generate scenarios and ask ""what if"" questions, then which parts of the process of model construction, analysis, and evolution benefit from and which are hindered by manual activities? The recent expansion of goal modelling to ask time-based questions further amplifies this issue because significant additional information is required from stakeholders. Through a series of empirical studies, we aim to isolate the processes of model construction, analysis, and evolution for the purpose of studying the utility of goal-oriented requirements engineering approaches and exploring which tasks are essential practices that stakeholders must complete themselves to gain modeling benefit, and which tasks can be simplified through automation. In this process, we will also measure the benefits of completing relevant goal modelling activities with and without timing analysis. In this short communication, we describe our objectives for understanding the benefits of and barriers to goal-oriented requirements engineering.",10.1109/RE.2018.00-22,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491153,Goal Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE);Empirical Studies;Modeling Automation,2,IEEE Conferences,,A.

Software Transparency as a Key Requirement for Self-Driving Cars,,"York University, Toronto, Canada; York University, Toronto, Canada; Pontificia Universidade Catolica, Brazil",14-Oct-18,"Self-Driving cars is a fast-growing area of study both in academia and industry. It is part of a broader domain which involves the development of software for Highly Automated Vehicles (HAV) and notions extracted from Artificial Intelligence/Autonomous Systems (AI/AS). There are many challenges that must be overcome to deliver self-driving cars in a manner that is readily accepted by consumers and society. Studies have shown that although many people are comfortable with the idea of AI helping them to operate their houses or schedule appointments, not many people are comfortable with the idea of cars being driven by AI algorithms. At the same time, insurance companies are concerned about vehicle liability issues and how to demonstrate who/what caused an accident. We believe that self-driving cars that demonstrate transparency in their operations will increase consumer trust which is pivotal to its acceptance and will pave the way for its commercialization and daily use. In this work, we investigate how to pursue the elicitation and modeling of transparency as a Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) to produce self-driving cars that are more robust.",10.1109/RE.2018.00-21,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491154,"Autonomous Systems, Non-Functional Requirements, Highly Automated Vehicles, and Transparency",33,IEEE Conferences,,L.

Speculative Requirements: Design Fiction and RE,,"Lancaster University, UK; Lancaster University, UK; Aston University, UK",14-Oct-18,"Many innovative software products are conceived, developed and deployed without any conventional attempt to elicit stakeholder requirements.

In this paper we consider how the conditions that enable new products' emergence might be better anticipated, making innovations a little less reliant on individual vision and a little more informed by stakeholder need. This is particularly important where a new technology would have the potential for social impact, good or bad. Speculative design seeks to explore this landscape.

However, today's projects growingly demand for agile and human-centered approaches to discover and meet the often fuzzy needs of the various stakeholders involved. In that regard, Design Thinking (DT) has become one of the most promising methods to address wicked problems and define innovative solutions. We see potential to combine both, the strongly human-oriented working mode of DT with the more formal, technology-driven world of RE, to develop human-centered solutions more effectively. Yet, little is known how such an integration could be realized and which concrete benefits and challenges to expect. To better understand this endeavor, we conduct a longitudinal case study to identify how DT and RE can work together in an agile development setting from the very beginning of idea conceptualization to market-ready implementation. In this paper, we summarize our research protocol and present first findings how Design Thinking can complement current RE practices through meeting known challenges encountered by the RE community of practitioners.

Automatic Glossary Term Extraction from Large-Scale Requirements Specifications,,"Technische Universität Berlin, Germany; Technische Universität Berlin, Germany; Technische Universität Berlin, Germany; Technische Universität Berlin, Germany",14-Oct-18,"Creating glossaries for large corpora of requirments is an important but expensive task. Glossary term extraction methods often focus on achieving a high recall rate and, therefore, favor linguistic proecssing for extracting glossary term candidates and neglect the benefits from reducing the number of candidates by statistical filter methods. However, especially for large datasets a reduction of the likewise large number of candidates may be crucial. This paper demonstrates how to automatically extract relevant domain-specific glossary term candidates from a large body of requirements, the CrowdRE dataset. Our hybrid approach combines linguistic processing and statistical filtering for extracting and reducing glossary term candidates. In a twofold evaluation, we examine the impact of our approach on the quality and quantity of extracted terms. We provide a ground truth for a subset of the requirements and show that a substantial degree of recall can be achieved. Furthermore, we advocate requirements coverage as an additional quality metric to assess the term reduction that results from our statistical filters. Results indicate that with a careful combination of linguistic and statistical extraction methods, a fair balance between later manual efforts and a high recall rate can be achieved.",10.1109/RE.2018.00052,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491159,Requirements Engineering;Natural Language Processing;Glossary Term Extraction;CrowdRE,14,IEEE Conferences,,T.

This data usually originates from different data sources. The challenge is identifying the right sources and finding relationships between them to make the analysis useful. To explore the relationship between product usage and performance, as well as changes in requirements, we have utilized data related to secure health communications to gain insight into possible links. We will explore the collection and processing of different types of data to facilitate requirements engineering in this setting. We will use data from multiple sources to get the volume of requirements and bugs, volume of users and user types, as well as system utilization and service usage.

Modeling Adaptive Socio-Cyber-Physical Systems with Goals and SysML,,"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada",14-Oct-18,"Socio-cyber-physical systems (SCPSs) are cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with a socio-technical system (STS) aspect. Several SCPSs need to adapt dynamically to changing situations in order to reach an optimal symbiosis with users in their contexts. Tailoring requirements engineering activities and modeling techniques is needed for developing SCPSs and supporting their runtime adaptability. The proposed thesis aims to combine a common way of modeling STSs (i.e., goal modeling with the Goal-oriented Requirement Language - GRL) to a conventional way of modeling CPSs (i.e., SysML and feature models) in order to integrate social concepts early in SCPS requirements, design, simulation, and implementation activities. To help guarantee system quality and compliance during both design time and runtime adaptations, the thesis proposes to translate goal and feature models to mathematical functions used to validate possible design and adaptation alternatives both during simulations at design time and adaptations at runtime. These functions can be used outside goal modeling tools and be combined to SysML models, simulations, problem solvers, and implementation tools. Furthermore, an integration between GRL and SysML models via a third-party requirements management system is proposed in order to strengthen system traceability and help ensure that stakeholder goals were considered properly during the SCPS development process.",10.1109/RE.2018.00059,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491166,Goal model;SysMl model;Socio cyber physical systems;self_adaptation,6,IEEE Conferences,,A.

Assessing Security Risk and Requirements for Systems of Systems,,"Bournemouth University Fern Barrow, Poole, UK",14-Oct-18,"A System of Systems (SoS) is a term used to describe independent systems converging for a purpose that could only be carried out through this interdependent collaboration. Many examples of SoSs exist, but the term has become a source of confusion across domains. Moreover, there are few illustrative SoS examples demonstrating their initial classification and structure. While there are many approaches for engineering of systems, less exist for SoS engineering. More specifically, there is a research gap towards approaches addressing SoS security risk assessment for engineering and operational needs, with a need for tool-support to assist modelling and visualising security risk and requirements in an interconnected SoS. From this, security requirements can provide a systematic means to identify constraints and related risks of the SoS, mitigated by human-user and system requirements.

Automated Validation of Requirement Reviews: A Machine Learning Approach,,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, USA",14-Oct-18,"Software development is fault-prone especially during the fuzzy phases (requirements and design). Software inspections are commonly used in industry to detect and fix problems in requirements and design artifacts thereby mitigating the fault propagation to later phases where same faults are harder to find and fix. The output of an inspection process is natural language (NL) reviews that report the location and description of faults in software requirements specification document (SRS). The artifact author must manually read through the reviews and differentiate between true-faults and false-positives before fixing the faults. The time spent in making effective post-inspection decisions (number of true faults and deciding whether to re-inspect) could be spent in doing actual development work. The goal of this research is to automate the validation of inspection reviews, finding common patterns that describe high-quality requirements, identify fault prone requirements pre-inspection, and interrelated requirements to assist fixation of reported faults post-inspection. To accomplish these goals, this research employs various classification approaches, NL processing with semantic analysis and mining solutions from graph theory to requirement reviews and NL requirements.

Cross-Functional Teams That Grok It: The Collective Empathic Understanding of Product Requirements,,"Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada",14-Oct-18,"Software development has become increasingly software 'product' development, without the authoritative 'customer' stakeholder role that many requirements engineering processes assume exists in some form. Many progressive software product companies today are empowering cross-functional product teams to own their product - to collectively understand the product context, the true product needs, and manage its on-going evolution. Some teams do this better than others and neither established requirements elicitation and validation processes nor conventional team leadership practices explain the reasons for the differences. This research inquires into how cross-functional product teams, as a collective, create and nurture a shared mental model that accurately represents the external product domain and its realities. The research also examines how teams use that collective understanding to shape development plans, internal and external communications, new team member onboarding, etc. The aim of this research is to develop substantive theory that describes how self-directed, cross-functional product development teams take an empathic-based approach to discovering, understanding, and maintaining a deep, collective understanding of the domain and true product needs.

Towards a Security Requirements Management Framework for Open-Source Software,,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA",14-Oct-18,"Security refers to a class of non-functional requirements (NFRs) related to system confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It plays a critical role in many open source software (OSS) projects. Experience indicates that considering security early in the software life cycle can help address security problems, such as reducing information breach and unauthorized data access. However, unlike up-front requirements engineering (RE), requirements are fully discussed and become elaborated in OSS projects only after the implementation begins. Therefore, security management approaches which based on up-front RE shall be modified or improved while applied to OSS projects. To make OSS projects more secure, this research extends existing security requirements management approaches and proposes a new security management framework for OSS projects.

Towards Goal-Oriented Process Mining,,"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada",14-Oct-18,"The growth of our digital world makes it possible to record many types of events. In particular, the number of business processes whose events are being logged is significantly increasing. Process mining is an approach that exploits event logs to discover real processes executed in organizations, enabling them to (re) design and improve process models. Goal modeling, on the other hand, is a requirements engineering approach mainly used to analyze what-if situations and support decision making. Common problems with process mining include the complexity of discovered ""spaghetti"" processes and a lack of goal-process alignment. Current process mining practices are mainly oriented towards activities and do not profit from considering stakeholder goals and requirements to manage complexity and alignment. Involving goal-related factors can augment the precision and interpretability of mined models and lead to better opportunities to satisfy stakeholders. In this research, I propose two methods (for goal-oriented process and enhancement discovery, and for conformance checking) that show potentially synergetic effects achievable by combining process mining and goal-oriented modeling.

As analysts have the full control over the elicitation process, their lack of knowledge about the system under study inhibits them from asking related questions and reduces the accuracy of requirements provided by stakeholders.

ELICA uses a novel information extraction algorithm based on a combination of Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) (generative model) and SVMs (discriminative model).

"Software Reuse and Reusability Based on Requirements: Product Lines, Cases and Feature-Similarity Models",,"TU Wien Vienna, Austria; Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, UK",14-Oct-18,"Several socioeconomic trends are increasing personalised customer demands. Suppliers are responding with mass customisation but the management of large-scale cost-effective software reuse remains a difficult challenge. Software reuse and reusability range from operational, ad-hoc and short-term to strategic, planned and long-term. Often the focus of attention is just on code or low-level design. This tutorial presents and compares two different requirements-led approaches. The first approach deals with requirements reuse and reusability in the context of product line engineering. The second approach deals with requirements reuse and reusability in the context of case-based reasoning. Both approaches have different key properties and trade-offs between the costs of making software artefacts reusable and the benefits of reusing them. To aid large-scale development we have proposed a Feature-Similarity Model, which draws on both approaches to facilitate discovering requirements relationships using similarity metrics. A Feature-Similarity Model also helps with the evolution of a product line, since new requirements can be introduced first into a case base and then gradually included into a product line representation.",10.1109/RE.2018.00010,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491184,"reuse, reusability, feature-similarity model, case-based reasoning",1,IEEE Conferences,,H.

Mining Twitter Feeds for Software User Requirements,,"Division of Computer Science and Engineering, Louisiana Sate University Baton Rouge, LA; Division of Computer Science and Engineering, Louisiana Sate University Baton Rouge, LA",25-Sep-17,"Twitter enables large populations of end-users of software to publicly share their experiences and concerns about software systems in the form of micro-blogs. Such data can be collected and classified to help software developers infer users' needs, detect bugs in their code, and plan for future releases of their systems. However, automatically capturing, classifying, and presenting useful tweets is not a trivial task. Challenges stem from the scale of the data available, its unique format, diverse nature, and high percentage of irrelevant information and spam. Motivated by these challenges, this paper reports on a three-fold study that is aimed at leveraging Twitter as a main source of software user requirements. The main objective is to enable a responsive, interactive, and adaptive data-driven requirements engineering process. Our analysis is conducted using 4,000 tweets collected from the Twitter feeds of 10 software systems sampled from a broad range of application domains. The results reveal that around 50% of collected tweets contain useful technical information.

SAFE: A Simple Approach for Feature Extraction from App Descriptions and App Reviews,,"University of Hamburg Hamburg, Germany; University of Hamburg Hamburg, Germany; University of Hamburg Hamburg, Germany; University of Hamburg Hamburg, Germany",25-Sep-17,"A main advantage of app stores is that they aggregate important information created by both developers and users. In the app store product pages, developers usually describe and maintain the features of their apps. In the app reviews, users comment these features. Recent studies focused on mining app features either as described by developers or as reviewed by users. However, extracting and matching the features from the app descriptions and the reviews is essential to bear the app store advantages, e.g. allowing analysts to identify which app features are actually being reviewed and which are not. In this paper, we propose SAFE, a novel uniform approach to extract app features from the single app pages, the single reviews and to match them. We manually build 18 part-of-speech patterns and 5 sentence patterns that are frequently used in text referring to app features. We then apply these patterns with several text pre-and post-processing steps. A major advantage of our approach is that it does not require large training and configuration data. To evaluate its accuracy, we manually extracted the features mentioned in the pages and reviews of 10 apps. The extraction precision and recall outperformed two state-of-the-art approaches. For well-maintained app pages such as for Google Drive our approach has a precision of 87% and on average 56% for 10 evaluated apps. SAFE also matches 87% of the features extracted from user reviews to those extracted from the app descriptions.",10.1109/RE.2017.71,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048887,User Reviews;App Store Analytics;Software Feature;Data Mining;Data-Driven Requirements,89,IEEE Conferences,,T.

The PoN consists of nine principles, but not all principles lend themselves equally to a clear and unambiguous operationalization. As a result, many visual notations designed according to the PoN apply it in different ways. The proposed framework guides what information is required of a reported PoN application to ensure that the application of each principle is verifiable. The framework utilizes an evidence-driven design rationale model to structure information needed to assess principles requiring user involvement or cognitive theories. This approach aims to reduce ambiguity in some of the principles by making design choices explicit, and highlighting the level of evidence presented to support it.

Using Argumentation to Explain Ambiguity in Requirements Elicitation Interviews,,"LERO, University of Limerick (UL), Limerick, Ireland; CNR-ISTI, Pisa, Italy; LERO, University of Limerick (UL), Limerick, Ireland; CNR-ISTI, Pisa, Italy; Kennesaw State University, Kennesaw, GA, US",25-Sep-17,"The requirements elicitation process often starts with an interview between a customer and a requirements analyst. During these interviews, ambiguities in the dialogic discourse may reveal the presence of tacit knowledge that needs to be made explicit. It is therefore important to understand the nature of ambiguities in interviews and to provide analysts with cognitive tools to identify and alleviate ambiguities. Ambiguities perceived by analysts are sometimes triggered by specific categories of terms used by the customer such as pronouns, quantifiers, and vague or under-specified terms. However, many of the ambiguities that arise in practice cannot be rooted in single terms. Rather, entire fragments of speech and their relation to the mental state of the analyst need to be considered.In this paper, we show that particular types of ambiguities can be characterised by means of argumentation theory. Argumentation is the study of how conclusions can be reached through logical reasoning. In an argumentation theory, statements are represented as arguments, and conflict relations among statements are represented as attacks. Based on a set of ambiguous fragments extracted from interviews, we define a model of the mental state of the analyst during an interview and translate it into an argumentation theory. Then, we show that many of the ambiguities can be characterized in terms of 'attacks' on arguments. The main novelty of this work is in addressing the problem of explaining fragment-level ambiguities in requirements elicitation interviews through the formal modeling of the analyst's mental model using argumentation theory. Our contribution provides a data-grounded, theoretical basis to have a more complete understanding of the ambiguity phenomenon, and lays the foundations to design intelligent computer-based agents that are able to automatically identify ambiguities.",10.1109/RE.2017.27,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048890,,14,IEEE Conferences,,Y.

In software engineering, rationale management focuses on capturing design and requirements decisions and on organizing and reusing project knowledge. This paper takes a different view on rationale written by users in online reviews. We studied 32,414 reviews for 52 software applications in the Amazon Store. Through a grounded theory approach and peer content analysis, we investigated how users argue and justify their decisions, e.g. about upgrading, installing, or switching software applications. We also studied the occurrence frequency of rationale concepts such as issues encountered or alternatives considered in the reviews and found that assessment criteria like performance, compatibility, and usability represent the most pervasive concept. We then used the truth set of manually labeled review sentences to explore how accurately we can mine rationale concepts from the reviews. Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, trained on the review metadata, syntax tree of the review text, and influential terms, achieved a precision around 80% for predicting sentences with alternatives and decisions, with top recall values of 98%. On the review level, precision was up to 13% higher with recall values reaching 99%.

Collecting and assessing the quality of such datasets are not trivial tasks and have been reported as an obstacle by many researchers in the domain of software engineering. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind study to review and assess the datasets that have been used in software traceability research over the last fifteen years. It presents and articulates the current status of these datasets, their characteristics, and their threats to validity. Furthermore, this paper introduces a Traceability-Dataset Quality Assessment (T-DQA) framework to categorize software traceability datasets and assist researchers to select appropriate datasets for their research based on different characteristics of the datasets and the context in which those datasets will be used.",10.1109/RE.2017.80,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048897,Software Traceability;Datasets Quality;Traceability Automation;Systematic Literature Review,16,IEEE Conferences,,W.

The Trouble with Security Requirements,,"Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT, Darmstadt, Germany",25-Sep-17,"Manifold approaches to security requirements engineering have been proposed, yet there is no consensus how to elicit, analyze, or express security needs. This perspective paper systematizes the problem space of security requirements engineering. Security needs result from the interplay of three dimensions: threats, security goals, and system design. Elementary statements can be made in each dimension, but such one-dimensional requirements remain partial and insufficient. To understand security needs, one has to analyze their interaction. Distinct analysis tasks arise for each pair of dimensions and are supported by different techniques: risk analysis, as in CORAS, between threats and security goals; security design, as exemplified by the framework of Haley et al., between goals and design; and security design analysis, such as Microsoft's threat modeling technique with data flow diagrams and STRIDE, between design and threats. All three perspectives are necessary to develop secure systems. Security requirements engineering must iterate through them, because threats determine the relevance of security goals, security design seeks ways to fulfill them, and design choices themselves influence threats and security goals.",10.1109/RE.2017.13,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048898,computer security;requirements engineering;system analysis and design;security risk;threat model;vulnerability;information security;software design;solution design,20,IEEE Conferences,,S.

Because of this, stakeholders (device makers, regulators, users, etc.) have increasing interest in enhancing security in medical devices. An effective means to approach this objective is to integrate systematic security requirements elicitation and analysis into the design and evaluation of medical device software. This paper extends the sequence-based enumeration approach, a systematic approach for defining the behavior of embedded software, to analyze the requirement documents of a medical device for the purpose of eliciting security requirements. As a proof of concept, we apply our approach on a concrete case study, which shows that the extended approach is useful for identifying sequences of medical device events that might be harmful to the patient, for example because the events are initiated by an active adversary trying to use the device in a malicious way. We then show how security requirements may be formulated based on the identified threats. By exploring these sequences systematically, the developers can reliably assess what, where, and how the security threats may manifest in their system, what the safety implications are, and finally they can evaluate the resulting requirements and mitigations.",10.1109/RE.2017.21,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048899,Medical device safety and security;requirements elicitation;sequence based enumeration,3,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Reinforcing Security Requirements with Multifactor Quality Measurement,,"Institute for Software Research, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA; College of Computing, King Abdul-Aziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",25-Sep-17,"Choosing how to write natural language scenarios is challenging, because stakeholders may over-generalize their descriptions or overlook or be unaware of alternate scenarios. In security, for example, this can result in weak security constraints that are too general, or missing constraints. Another challenge is that analysts are unclear on where to stop generating new scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Multifactor Quality Method (MQM) to help requirements analysts to empirically collect system constraints in scenarios based on elicited expert preferences. The method combines quantitative statistical analysis to measure system quality with qualitative coding to extract new requirements. The method is bootstrapped with minimal analyst expertise in the domain affected by the quality area, and then guides an analyst toward selecting expert-recommended requirements to monotonically increase system quality. We report the results of applying the method to security. This include 550 requirements elicited from 69 security experts during a bootstrapping stage, and subsequent evaluation of these results in a verification stage with 45 security experts to measure the overall improvement of the new requirements. Security experts in our studies have an average of 10 years of experience. Our results show that using our method, we detect an increase in the security quality ratings collected in the verification stage. Finally, we discuss how our proposed method helps to improve security requirements elicitation, analysis, and measurement.",10.1109/RE.2017.77,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048900,user study;vignettes;scenarios;security requirements;requirements elicitation;qualitative analysis;context,,IEEE Conferences,,H.

“SHORT”er Reasoning About Larger Requirements Models,,"Computer Science, NC State University, USA; Computer Science, NC State University, USA; Software Engineering Institute, Pittsburgh, USA; Software Engineering Institute, Pittsburgh, USA",25-Sep-17,"When Requirements Engineering(RE) models are unreasonably complex, they cannot support efficient decision making. SHORT is a tool to simplify that reasoning by exploiting the ""key"" decisions within RE models. These ""keys"" have the property that once values are assigned to them, it is very fast to reason over the remaining decisions. Using these ""keys"", reasoning about RE models can be greatly SHORTened by focusing stakeholder discussion on just these key decisions.This paper evaluates the SHORT tool on eight complex RE models. We find that the number of keys are typically only 12% of all decisions. Since they are so few in number, keys can be used to reason faster about models. For example, using keys, we can optimize over those models (to achieve the most goals at least cost) two to three orders of magnitude faster than standard methods. Better yet, finding those keys is not difficult: SHORT runs in low order polynomial time and terminates in a few minutes for the largest models.",10.1109/RE.2017.31,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048901,Requirements engineering;softgoals;optimization;search-based software engineering,5,IEEE Conferences,,G.

Modeling and Reasoning with Changing Intentions: An Experiment,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada",25-Sep-17,"Existing modeling approaches in requirements engineering assume that stakeholder goals are static: once set, they remain the same throughout the lifecycle of the project. Of course, such goals, like anything else, may change over time. In earlier work, we introduced Evolving Intentions: an approach that allows stakeholders to specify how evaluations of goal model elements change over time. Simulation over Evolving Intentions enables stakeholders to ask a variety of 'what if' questions, and evaluate possible evolutions of a goal model. GrowingLeaf is a web-based tool that implements both the modeling and analysis components of this approach. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness and usability of Evolving Intentions, Simulation over Evolving Intentions, and GrowingLeaf. We report on a between-subjects experiment we conducted with fifteen graduate students familiar with requirements engineering.

In particular, there is a wealth of published material on formal goal modelling approaches. However, the uptake of the goal approaches advocated by academics and researchers within real world settings appears to be quite low. Where goals are used in industrial practice their use is mainly informal and the methods used are inconsistent. There appears to be a significant gap between research and practice in the use of goals within requirements engineering. A two-part study was undertaken to check whether there is evidence to support this view of a disconnection between research and industry. Firstly, a literature survey of requirements engineering papers about goals reveals a large body of published material, but the majority has little industrial involvement. Secondly, a questionnaire completed by experienced requirements engineering practitioners suggests that use of goals in practice is inconsistent, informal, and rarely utilises formal modelling approaches.

How Much Undocumented Knowledge is there in Agile Software Development?: Case Study on Industrial Project Using Issue Tracking System and Version Control System,,"Software Innovation Center, NTT Corporation, Tokyo, Japan; Software Innovation Center, NTT Corporation, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Information Systems, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA; Software Innovation Center, NTT Corporation, Tokyo, Japan",25-Sep-17,"In agile software development projects, software engineers prioritize implementation over documentation to eliminate needless documentation. Is the cost of missing documentation greater than the cost of producing unnecessary or unused documentation? Even without these documents, software engineers maintain other software artifacts, such as tickets in an issue tracking system (ITS) or source code committed to a version control system (VCS). Do these artifacts contain the necessary knowledge? In this paper, we examine undocumented knowledge in an agile software development project at NTT. For our study, we collected 159 commit logs in a VCS and 102 tickets in the ITS from the three-month period of the project. We propose a ticket-commit network chart (TCC) that visually represents time-series commit activities along with filed issue tickets. We also implement a tool to generate the TCC using both commit log and ticket data. Our study revealed that in 16% of all commits, software engineers committed source code to the VCS without a corresponding issue ticket in the ITS.

Improving the Identification of Hedonic Quality in User Requirements — A Controlled Experiment,,"Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering IESE, Kaiserslautern, Germany; Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering IESE, Kaiserslautern, Germany",25-Sep-17,"Context and Motivation Systematically engineering a good user experience (UX) into a computer-based system under development demands that the user requirements of the system reflect all needs, including emotional, of all stakeholders. User requirements address two different types of qualities: pragmatic qualities (PQs), that address system functionality and usability, and hedonic qualities (HQs) that address the stakeholder's psychological well-being. Studies show that users tend to describe such satisfying UXes mainly with PQs, and that some users seem to believe that they are describing a HQ when they are actually describing a PQ. Question/Problem The problem is to see if classification of any user requirement as PQ-related or HQ-related is difficult, and if so, why. Principal Ideas/Results We conducted a controlled experiment in which twelve requirements-engineering and UX professionals, hereinafter called ""classifiers"" classified each of 105 user requirements as PQ-related or HQ-related. The experiment shows that neither (1) a classifier's involvement in the project from which the requirements came nor (2) the classifier's use of a detailed model of the qualities in addition to the standard definitions of ""PQ"" and ""HQ"" has a positive effect on the consistency of the classifier's classification with that of others.

We found that RE-specific tools constrain engineers to a rigid workflow, which is conflicting with the adaptive exploration of the problem. Engineers often start by using general-purpose tools to foster exploration and collaborative work with suppliers, at the expense of traceability. When engineers shift to requirements refinement and verification, they must use RE-specific tools to grant traceability.

A Case Study on a Specification Approach Using Activity Diagrams in Requirements Documents,,"Technische Universität Berlin, Germany; Technische Universität Berlin, Germany; Technische Universität Berlin, Germany",25-Sep-17,"Rising complexity of systems has long been a major challenge in requirements engineering. This manifests in more extensive and harder to understand requirements documents. At the Daimler AG, an approach is applied that combines the use of activity diagrams with natural language specifications to specify system functions. The approach starts with an activity diagram that is created to get an early overview. The contained information is then transferred to a textual requirements document, where details are added and the behavior is refined. While the approach aims to reduce efforts needed to understand a system's behavior, the application of the approach itself causes new challenges on its own. By examining existing specifications at Daimler, we identified nine categories of inconsistencies and deviations between activity diagrams and their textual representations. In a case study, we examined one system in detail to assess how often these occur. In a follow-up survey, we presented instances of the categories to different stakeholders of the system and let them asses the categories regarding their severity. Our analysis indicates that a coexistence of textual and graphical representations of models without proper tool support results in inconsistencies and deviations that may cause severe maintenance costs or even provoke faults in subsequent development steps.",10.1109/RE.2017.28,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048911,,5,IEEE Conferences,,M.

A Formalization Method to Process Structured Natural Language to Logic Expressions to Detect Redundant Specification and Test Statements,,"Research and Development MB Passenger Cars, Daimler AG; Research and Development MB Passenger Cars, Daimler AG; Research and Development MB Passenger Cars, Daimler AG; University of Stuttgart, ISD",25-Sep-17,"Automotive systems are constantly increasing in complexity and size. Beside the increase of requirements specifications and related test specification due to new systems and higher system interaction, we observe an increase of redundant specifications. As the predominant specification language (both for requirements and test cases) is still natural text, it is not easy to detect these redundancies. In principle, to detect these redundancies, each statement has to be compared to all others. This proves to be difficult because of number and informal expression of statements. In this paper we propose a solution to the problem of detecting redundant specification and test statements described in structured natural language. We propose a formalization process for requirements specification and test statements, allowing us to detect redundant statements and thus reduce the efforts for specification and validation. Specification Pattern Systems and Linear Temporal Logic provide the base for our process. We did evaluate the method in the context of Mercedes-Benz Passenger Car Development.

Do Words Make a Difference?

A very simple taxonomy is the distinction between functional and non-functional requirements. Furthermore, a taxonomy helps to decide if a statement is a requirement at all or just something else (e.g., 'information'). The quality of a taxonomy is important as we do not want to put a statement in the wrong category.In this paper, we argue that we need to take cognitive psychology into account in this task of requirements classification. Cognitive psychology focuses on the abilities and limitations of the human mind. We present a controlled experiment and a replication in which we compare three requirements taxonomies.The participants had to evaluate a set of requirements based on the given taxonomies. The results of these experiments show that there are differences between the taxonomies: Interestingly, the question whether a statement is identified as a requirement or not depends on the taxonomy.

An Evaluation of Constituency-Based Hyponymy Extraction from Privacy Policies,,"Bard College, New York, United States; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States",25-Sep-17,"Requirements analysts can model regulated data practices to identify and reason about risks of non-compliance. If terminology is inconsistent or ambiguous, however, these models and their conclusions will be unreliable. To study this problem, we investigated an approach to automatically construct an information type ontology by identifying information type hyponymy in privacy policies using Tregex patterns. Tregex is a utility to match regular expressions against constituency parse trees, which are hierarchical expressions of natural language clauses, including noun and verb phrases. We discovered the Tregex patterns by applying content analysis to 30 privacy policies from six domains (shopping, telecommunication, social networks, employment, health, and news.) From this dataset, three semantic and four lexical categories of hyponymy emerged based on category completeness and word-order. Among these, we identified and empirically evaluated 72 Tregex patterns to automate the extraction of hyponyms from privacy policies.

But often an objective evaluation that the resulting gamified tasks successfully meet the intended goal is missing. On the other hand, current practices in designing gamified processes seem to rest on a try, test and learn approach, rather than on first principles design methods. Thus empirical evaluation should play an even more important role.We combined gamification and automated reasoning techniques to support collaborative requirements prioritization in software evolution. A first prototype has been evaluated in the context of three industrial use cases. To further investigate the impact of specific game elements, namely point-based elements, we performed a quasi-experiment comparing two versions of the tool, with and without pointsification.

Behind Points and Levels — The Influence of Gamification Algorithms on Requirements Prioritization,,"Department of Informatics, Universitat Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",25-Sep-17,"Prioritizing requirements is a crucial ingredient of successful Requirements Engineering (RE). The popular prioritization techniques assume that stakeholders are known and can be mandated to contribute to the prioritization process. This prerequisite no longer holds for many of today's systems where significant stakeholders (end-users, in particular) are outside organizational reach: they are neither known nor can they be identified among the members of the involved organizations. Classic techniques for involving these stakeholders such as polls or questionnaires are neither interactive nor collaborative, which is detrimental for prioritization. Social media enable collaborative prioritization, but fall short in motivating stakeholders outside organizational reach to participate voluntarily. In this light, we are developing the Garuso platform, which combines social media with gamification for motivating stakeholders. While first approaches to employing gamification in RE are promising, research is still in its infancy. Especially, little is known about the influence of the gamification algorithms controlling single game elements on the stakeholders' activities. In this paper we report on a field experiment in which we investigated this influence with Garuso. We found statistically significant differences between different algorithms controlling single game elements on the contributions of stakeholders to the prioritization of requirements.",10.1109/RE.2017.59,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049139,gamification;requirements prioritization;stake-holder motivation;field experiment,8,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Task Interruptions in Requirements Engineering: Reality Versus Perceptions!,,"University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, CA; Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada; Arcurve Inc., Calgary, Canada",25-Sep-17,"Task switching and interruptions are a daily reality in software development projects: developers switch between Requirements Engineering (RE), coding, testing, daily meetings, and other tasks. Task switching may increase productivity through increased information flow and effective time management. However, it might also cause a cognitive load to reorient the primary task, which accounts for the decrease in developers' productivity and increases in errors. This cognitive load is even greater in cases of cognitively demanding tasks as the ones typical for RE activities. In this paper, to compare the reality of task switching in RE with the perception of developers, we conducted two studies: (i) a case study analysis on 5,076 recorded tasks of 19 developers and (ii) a survey of 25 developers. The results of our retrospective analysis show that in ALL of the cases that the disruptiveness of RE interruptions is statistically different from other software development tasks, RE related tasks are more vulnerable to interruptions compared to other task types. Moreover, we found that context switching, the priority of the interrupting task, and the interruption source and timing are key factors that impact RE interruptions. We also provided a set of RE task switching patterns along with recommendations for both practitioners and researchers. While the results of our retrospective analysis show that self-interruptions are more disruptive than external interruptions, developers have different perceptions about the disruptiveness of various sources of interruptions.",10.1109/RE.2017.75,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049140,Requirements Engineering;Task Interruptions;Multitasking;Task Switching;Empirical Software Engineering,5,IEEE Conferences,,Z.

What do Support Analysts Know About Their Customers? On the Study and Prediction of Support Ticket Escalations in Large Software Organizations,,"SEGAL Lab, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada; SEGAL Lab, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada",25-Sep-17,"Understanding and keeping the customer happy is a central tenet of requirements engineering. Strategies to gather, analyze, and negotiate requirements are complemented by efforts to manage customer input after products have been deployed. For the latter, support tickets are key in allowing customers to submit their issues, bug reports, and feature requests. Whenever insufficient attention is given to support issues, however, their escalation to management is time-consuming and expensive, especially for large organizations managing hundreds of customers and thousands of support tickets. Our work provides a step towards simplifying the job of support analysts and managers, particularly in predicting the risk of escalating support tickets. In a field study at our large industrial partner, IBM, we used a design science methodology to characterize the support process and data available to IBM analysts in managing escalations. Through iterative cycles of design and evaluation, we translated our understanding of support analysts' expert knowledge of their customers into features of a support ticket model to be implemented into a Machine Learning model to predict support ticket escalations. We trained and evaluated our Machine Learning model on over 2.5 million support tickets and 10,000 escalations, obtaining a recall of 79.9% and an 80.8% reduction in the workload for support analysts looking to identify support tickets at risk of escalation. Further on-site evaluations, through a prototype tool we developed to implement our Machine Learning techniques in practice, showed more efficient weekly support-ticket-management meetings. The features we developed in the Support Ticket Model are designed to serve as a starting place for organizations interested in implementing our model to predict support ticket escalations, and for future researchers to build on to advance research in escalation prediction.",10.1109/RE.2017.61,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049142,Customer relationship management;machine learning;escalation prediction;customer support ticket,15,IEEE Conferences,,L.

Extrapolating from a pilot project on reliable wireless communication in Boliden's Kankberg mine, we propose establishing a System-of-Systems (SoS) with LiDAR-equipped haulers and existing mapping solutions as constituent systems. SoS requirements engineering inevitably adds a political layer, as independent actors are stakeholders both on the system and SoS levels. We present four SoS scenarios representing different business models, discussing how development and operations could be distributed among Boliden and external stakeholders, e.g., the vehicle suppliers, the hauling company, and the developers of the mapping software. Based on eight key variation points, we compare the four scenarios from both technical and business perspectives.

Optimized Functionality for Super Mobile Apps,,"SEDS Laboratory University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada; SEDS Laboratory University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada",25-Sep-17,"Functionality of software products often does not match user needs and expectations. The closed set-up of systems and information is replaced by wide access to data of users and competitor products. This shift offers completely new opportunities to approach requirements elicitation and subsequent planning of software functionality. This is, in particular true for app store markets. App stores are markets for many small sized software products which provide an open platform for users to provide feedback on using apps. Moreover, the functionality and status of similar software products can be retrieved. While this is a competitive risk, it is at the same time an opportunity.In this paper, we envision a new release planning approach that leverages the new opportunities for decision making. We propose a new model using bi-criterion integer programming. We make suggestions for optimized super app functionality that are based on two key aspects: (i) the estimated value of features, and (ii) the cohesiveness between newly added features and cohesiveness between existing and the features to be added. The information on these attributes comes from reasoning on feature composition of existing similar apps.

To help companies write better privacy requirements that embody the use limitations and collection limitation principles, we conducted a case study to identify how purpose is expressed among five privacy policies from the shopping domain. Using content analysis, we discovered six exclusive data purpose categories. In addition, we observed natural language patterns to express purpose.

Based on this intuition, we propose to investigate the difference between ambiguities explicitly revealed by an analyst during a requirements elicitation interview, and ambiguities annotated by a reviewer who listens to the interview recording, with the objective of defining a method for interview review. We performed an exploratory study in which two subjects listened to a set of customer-analyst interviews.

Generally, these weights are defined at design-time with the support of previous experiences and domain experts.

We prototyped the RETTA tool which leverages the wisdom of the crowd and combines it with machine learning approaches such as Natural Language Processing and Naïve Bayes to help with the requirements elicitation and classification task in the TM domain.

ECrits — Visualizing Support Ticket Escalation Risk,,"SEGAL Lab, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada; SEGAL Lab, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada; SEGAL Lab, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada",25-Sep-17,"Managing support tickets in large, multi-product organizations is difficult. Failure to meet the expectations of customers can lead to the escalation of support tickets, which is costly for IBM in terms of customer relationships and resources spent addressing the escalation. Keeping the customer happy is an important task in requirements engineering, which often comes in the form of handling their problems brought forth in support tickets. Proper attention to customers, their issues, and the bottom-up requirements that surface through bug reports can be difficult when the support process involves spending a lot of time managing customers to prevent escalations. For any given support analyst, understanding the customer is achievable through time spent looking through past and present support tickets within their organization; however, this solution does not scale up to account for all support tickets across all product teams. ECrits is a tool developed to help mitigate information overload by selectively mining customer information from support ticket repositories, displaying that data to support analysts, and doing predictive modelling on that data to suggest which support tickets are likely to escalate.",10.1109/RE.2017.62,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049157,,6,IEEE Conferences,,L.

Furthermore, we assessed how accurately we can identify various types of NFRs, in particular usability, security, operational, and performance requirements. We developed and evaluated a supervised machine learning approach employing meta-data, lexical, and syntactical features. We employed under-and over-sampling strategies to handle the imbalanced classes in the dataset and cross-validated the classifiers using precision, recall, and F1 metrics in a series of experiments based on the Support Vector Machine classifier algorithm.

Considering that domain-specific data sets are often not readily available, we propose a domain-independent model for classifying security requirements based on two key ideas. First, we train our model on the description of weaknesses from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) data set. Although CWE does not describe requirements, it describes security weaknesses that are manifestations of unrealized security requirements. Second, we exploit a one-class classification model that relies only on positive samples (description of weaknesses in CWE), eliminating the need for negative samples, collecting which can be nontrivial.We evaluated our model on three industrial requirements documents from different domains. We found that a One-Class Support Vector Machine trained with domain-independent CWE data set outperforms a model from prior literature by identifying security requirements with an average precision, recall and F-score of 67.35%, 70.48% and 67.68%, respectively. Further, considering data sets from prior literature (consisting of both positive and negative examples), we found that one-class classifiers trained with only positive examples outperformed binary classifiers trained with both positive and negative examples in two out of three evaluation data sets, demonstrating the potential value of one-class classification for security requirements identification.",10.1109/RE.2017.79,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049174,security requirements;classification;common weakness enumeration;domain-independent;one-class svm,9,IEEE Conferences,,N.

Towards a Bayesian Decision Model for Release Planning in Incremental Development,,"Department of Computer Science, University College London, United Kingdom",25-Sep-17,"Incremental software development focuses on delivering working software in small increments so as to deliver early business value and minimize the risks of developing inadequate system requirements. Release planning is the activity that consist in planning what features and software qualities will be delivered in each release. Release planning decisions are complex due to conflicting stakeholders' objectives, uncertainty, and complex project constraints. Judgement-based approaches to release planning decisions are commonly adopted in practice but are subject to severe biases and lack of transparency. Model-based approaches have been proposed to address these problems but most methods use generic models that do not fit stakeholders' concerns and provide limited support for modelling and reasoning about uncertainty.

An Approach to Support the Specification of Agile Artifacts in the Development of Safety-Critical Systems,,"Technische Universitat Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Rheinland-Pfalz, DE",25-Sep-17,"Providing a correct, complete, and unambiguous requirements specification is still one of the biggest challenges in software engineering. In the case of safety-critical systems, this challenge is even greater, since misinterpretations can lead to catastrophic damages to humans and to the environment. Agile development proposes minimizing the challenges in requirements specifications through short iterations, quick feedback, and active stakeholders. However, in safety-critical systems development, there is a gap (either geographical, cultural, educational, or temporal) between safety engineers and developers. [Question Problem] Therefore, it is not possible to be assured by agile development teams that safety aspects are well understood by developers, and, if the latter are aware of the criticality of the problem, that they can implement them accordingly. [Principal Ideas Results] The proposed research aims to provide adequate support for more accurate specification of agile development artifacts in the development of safety-critical systems. In this regard, the first contribution of this research aims at defining an Agile Safety Process, whose purpose is to identify which artifacts or parts thereof are enough to specify failure detection and containment, as well as measures for taking the system to a safe state. The second contribution aims at providing a semi-automated methodology for supporting the specification of agile artifacts, taking into account safety aspects.

Reusable Goal Models,,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada",25-Sep-17,"Goal models help elicit, specify, analyze, and validate requirements as they capture hierarchical representations of system requirements, possible solutions, stakeholder objectives, and their relationships. In the early requirements phase, goal models aid requirements engineers in understanding the goals of stakeholders and exploring solution alternatives based on their impact on these goals. Despite these strengths of goal modeling, reuse of goal models has received limited attention in the goal modeling community for various reasons. We argue that the requirements that need to be fulfilled at least for the reuse of goal models are as follows: (i) ensure that trade-off reasoning via goal model evaluation is possible through the reuse hierarchy, (ii) provide the means to delay decisions to a later point in the reuse hierarchy when more complete information is available, while still allowing the reusable artifact to be analyzed, (iii) take into account constraints imposed by other modeling notations when evaluating reusable goal models, (iv) allow context dependent information to be modeled so that the goal model can be used and analyzed in various application contexts, and (v) last but not the least, provide a well-defined interface for reuse.

Strategic planning precedes more detailed requirements engineering activities that clarify the requirements for the software systems concerned by the strategic plan. [Question/Problem]: Unfortunately, strategic goals are often vague and the IT projects in the strategic plans are sometimes not well aligned with these goals and not flexible enough to deal with uncertainty and changing conditions. [Previous work/Limitations]: Goal-oriented requirements engineering methods have been proposed to help strategic decision-making. These methods include various qualitative and quantitative techniques, but they lack support for deciding the timings of IT initiatives, for rigorously collecting and analyzing data to support strategic decisions, and for revising strategic plans based on changing conditions and past knowledge. [Principal ideas/Approach]: The objective of my research is to extend goal-oriented requirements engineering techniques to provide such support in the context of strategic planning activities. My approach will involve designing an adaptive framework with support for goal modelling and reasoning about the timing of IT initiatives and for enabling data-driven decisions using machine learning and Bayesian decision analysis techniques. [Contribution]: This paper presents a partial example illustrating the problems I wish to address, preliminary ideas on how to solve them, and a research roadmap to achieve my research objectives.",10.1109/RE.2017.53,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049180,strategic decision-making;business intelligence;goal modeling;requirement engineering;software engineering,3,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Dealing with Conflicts Between Non-functional Requirements of UbiComp and IoT Applications,,"Software Engineering and Systems — GREat Computer Science Department (DC) Federal University of Ceará-UFC, Group of Computer Networks, Fortaleza, Brazil",25-Sep-17,"Conflicts between non-functional requirements (NFRs) mean that achieving one requirement can impact another one. This can happen if a particular procedure (called ""operationalizing softgoal"" in the literature) favors the first characteristic but creates difficulty for the second one. Currently, the conflict identification uses catalogs to indicate conflicting NFRs. They focus on NFRs that are generic to any system. However, the advent of Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) and Internet of Things (IoT) introduce new kind of NFRs (e.g., Context-Awareness and Mobility) that are not included in these catalogs and can impact the traditional ones (e.g., Security and Usability). Therefore, the aim of this Ph.D. thesis is to propose a catalog of conflicts among NFRs of UbiComp and IoT applications that consider their operationalizing softgoals. Additionally, to help construct this catalog, this thesis considers analyzing the operationalizing softgoals in design time using executable models.",10.1109/RE.2017.51,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049181,Conflict;Trade-off;Non-Functional Requirements;Quality Characteristics;Internet of Things;Ubiquitous Computing,10,IEEE Conferences,,R.

Awareness Driven Software Reengineering,,"Informatics Department, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, BR",25-Sep-17,"As software changes, it may become more difficult to under-stand, to be changed and harder to be reusable. In such cases, reengineering is a well-suited approach. While reengineering a system for renovation and reclamation, an organization gener-ally reassesses how the system implements high-level business requirements and makes modifications to conform to desired changes. Reengineering usually involves some form of reverse engineering to achieve a more abstract description of the soft-ware. We consider that a self-adaptive system implements awareness requirements, a high-level abstraction for self-adaptation. Awareness requirements are nonfunctional re-quirements (NFRs) about the software environment, as well as about the software itself (i.e.: the ability to perceive what is hap-pening about itself) for management and/or adaptation purpos-es. Most of the effort on self-adaptive system reengineering is focused on separation of concerns (i.e.: adaptation logic and application logic) or evolve a non-adaptive to a self-adaptive system. We identified that the design recovery approaches being used, limit themselves to recover the application logic, thus leav-ing the adaptation logic in low-level models. This fact leads to lack of proper integration at high-level models, resulting in im-plementation problems. Our research aims to tackle these prob-lems, by using the concept of awareness requirements as soft-goal in a goal-oriented model. We understand that recovering the adaptation operationalization and mapping them onto an i* based goal model will provide a high-level description of both the adaptation logic as well as the application logic.",10.1109/RE.2017.52,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049182,Awareness Requirements;Self-Adaptive Software Reengineering;Reverse Engineering for Self-Adaptive System,2,IEEE Conferences,,A.

Verifying Cyber-Physical System Behavior in the Context of Cyber-Physical System-Networks,,"Paluno-The Ruhr Institute for Software Technology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany",25-Sep-17,"Cyber-physical systems are highly connected context sensitive systems that form networks. Within these cyber-physical system-networks, behavior emerges from the interplay of the connected systems that cannot be attributed to a single system. Verifying single system behavior as well as the resulting emergent behavior of the system-network the single systems contribute to, is challenging as the intended behavior differs between the different cyber-physical system-networks the single system takes part in. It can even differ between two almost identical cyber-physical system-networks, which, for example, only differ by one system. To ensure correct behavior, requirements engineering for cyber-physical systems must cope with the identification and documentation of the cyber-physical system's dynamic context, i.e. the different system-networks the system takes part in (e.g., a system-network of vehicles forming a platoon on a highway) as well as the context situations these system-networks can encounter (e.g., road work leading to the need for lane shifts).

Improving the Elicitation of Delightful Context-Aware Features: A Data-Based Approach,,"Department of User Experience and Requirements Engineering Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering IESE Kaiserslautern, Germany",25-Sep-17,"The pursuit of innovation in the mobile software industry frequently requires coming up with new features - and not just any feature, but startling and unexpected delightful features. Despite the potential of context awareness to provide a system with delightfulness, current requirements elicitation techniques do not cope with an essential aspect: comprehension of the relationships among the numerous contextual elements of a certain domain and how they can positively influence the user task. As a result, solution providers continuously miss the opportunity to add more value to their software solutions by identifying context-aware behaviors that will lead to better recommendations or adaptations. This paper discusses this problem and proposes a process for tackling it by taking the task to be improved as input and semi-automatically generating (1) a conceptual context model that reveals and represents both the relevance of contextual elements and the relationships among them, and (2) candidate requirements.

Requirements for Molecular Programmed Nanosystems (Keynote),,"Iowa State University, Ames, IA, US",05-Dec-16,"Molecular programming of DNA makes use of computeraided design, a programming language to encode the design, and a a compiler that compiles the code into a list of corresponding DNA strands.

Applications of molecular programming that are on the horizon for commercial production include targeted and personalized medical applications, biosensors for air and water, molecular robots that can navigate in cells, and biocompatible computational devices. In this talk I describe the experiences and results of our interdisciplinary team in applying goal-oriented requirements techniques, reaction network modeling, and probabilistic model checking to molecular programmed nanosystems. Requirements challenges include handling scalability to very large numbers of devices or services (roughly similar to the internet of things), dealing with probabilistic behavior, and understanding the limits of safe operation in changing (literally fluid) environments.

As known from the experience in other fields and disciplines, visualization can potentially provide more insights into data, information and knowledge studied. While research in the area of information visualization and its application to software engineering has rapidly increased over the last decade, there is only a limited amount of studies addressing the usage and impact of visualization techniques for RE activities. In this paper, we report on the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) related to RE visualization. Extending the established SLR process by the usage of grounded theory for the encoding of papers, we synthesize 18 usage patterns. Even though there are punctual applications, there is a clear deficit on a holistic perspective across the different RE activities.

A Serious Game for Eliciting Social Engineering Security Requirements,,"Technische Universität München, Germany; Goethe-University Frankfurt, Germany",05-Dec-16,"Social engineering is the acquisition of information about computer systems by methods that deeply include nontechnical means. While technical security of most critical systems is high, the systems remain vulnerable to attacks from social engineers. Social engineering is a technique that: (i) does not require any (advanced) technical tools, (ii) can be used by anyone, (iii) is cheap. Traditional security requirements elicitation approaches often focus on vulnerabilities in network or software systems. Few approaches even consider the exploitation of humans via social engineering and none of them elicits personal behaviours of individual employees. While the amount of social engineering attacks and the damage they cause rise every year, the security awareness of these attacks and their consideration during requirements elicitation remains negligible. We propose to use a card game to elicit these requirements, which all employees of a company can play to understand the threat and document security requirements. The game considers the individual context of a company and presents underlying principles of human behaviour that social engineers exploit, as well as concrete attack patterns.

For web-based and mobile information systems, ambiguity, and vagueness inparticular, undermines the ability of organizations to align their privacy policies with their data practices, which can confuse or mislead users thus leading to an increase in privacy risk. In this paper, we introduce a theory of vagueness for privacy policy statements based on a taxonomy of vague terms derived from an empirical content analysis of 15 privacy policies. The taxonomy was evaluated in a paired comparison experiment and results were analyzed using the Bradley-Terry model to yield a rank order of vague terms in both isolation and composition. The theory predicts how vague modifiers to information actions and information types can be composed to increase or decrease overall vagueness. We further provide empirical evidence based on factorial vignette surveys to show how increases in vagueness will decrease users' acceptance of privacy risk and thus decrease users' willingness to share personal information.",10.1109/RE.2016.20,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765508,vagueness;hedging;natural language processing;privacy;risk perception,38,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Challenging Incompleteness of Performance Requirements by Sentence Patterns,,"Technische Universität München, Germany; Technische Universität, Berlin, DCAITI, Germany; Technische Universität München, Germany; Technische Universität, Berlin, DCAITI, Germany",05-Dec-16,"Performance requirements play an important role in software development. They describe system behavior that directly impacts the user experience. Specifying performance requirements in a way that all necessary content is contained, i.e., the completeness of the individual requirements, is challenging, yet project critical. Furthermore, it is still an open question, what content is necessary to make a performance requirement complete. To address this problem, we introduce a framework for specifying performance requirements. This framework (i) consists of a unified model derived from existing performance classifications, (ii) denotes completeness through a content model, and (iii) is operationalized through sentence patterns. We evaluate both the applicability of the framework as well as its ability uncover incompleteness with performance requirements taken from 11 industrial specifications. In our study, we were able to specify 86% of the examined performance requirements by means of our framework.

Ambiguity Cues in Requirements Elicitation Interviews,,"ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy; Kennesaw State University, Georgia, USA; ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy",05-Dec-16,"Customer-analyst interviews are considered among the most effective means to perform requirements elicitation. However, during these interviews, ambiguity can hamper communication between customer and requirements analyst. Ambiguity is particularly dangerous in those cases in which the analyst misunderstands some linguistic expression of the customer, with-out being aware of the misunderstanding. On the other hand, if the analyst is able to detect ambiguous situations, this has been shown to help him/her in disclosing tacit knowledge. Indeed, the occurrence of an ambiguity might reveal the presence of unexpressed, system-relevant knowledge that needs to be elicited. Therefore, for the requirements elicitation interview to succeed, it is important for the analyst not to overlook ambiguities. To support the ambiguity-awareness of the requirements analyst, this paper aims to provide a set of cues that can be identified in the linguistic expressions of the customer, and that typically lead to ambiguity. To this end, we performed 34 customer-analyst interviews, and we isolated the speech fragments that caused the ambiguity. Based on the analysis of these fragments, and leveraging the previous literature on ambiguity in written requirements, we identified a set of cues that can be used by requirements analysts as a reference handbook to detect ambiguities.",10.1109/RE.2016.25,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765511,Requirements Elicitation;Interviews;Ambiguity;Ambiguity Cue;Generality;Ambiguity in Spoken Language,12,IEEE Conferences,,A.

An Exploratory Study on User Interaction Challenges When Handling Interconnected Requirements Artifacts of Various Sizes,,"Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland",05-Dec-16,"Requirements documentation is essential for developing software systems of non-trivial size. The cost of creating and maintaining documentation artifacts in terms of time and effort is significantly influenced by the tools with which engineers view, navigate and edit documentation artifacts. However, there is not much evidence about how well documentation tools actually support engineers, particularly when dealing with artifacts that are larger than the available display screen and with multiple artifacts at the same time. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study based on 29 interviews with software practitioners to understand the current practice of presenting and manipulating artifacts in documentation tools, and how practitioners deal with the challenges encountered. Our study shows that a significant number of artifacts cannot be viewed entirely, even on large screens. Moreover, more than half of the participants use four or more artifacts concurrently. Nevertheless, current tools only provide primitive capabilities for handling concurrent and large artifacts, thus forcing engineers to create, for example, mental images of the currently used artifacts or use workarounds such as hanging printouts to the wall.

An Exploratory Study on Handling Requirements and Acceptance Test Documentation in Industry,,"Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland",05-Dec-16,"With the emergence and spread of agile processes, the practices of writing and maintaining documentation have drastically changed in the last decade. In this work, we performed a qualitative study to explore the current practices for managing two related types of software documentation: requirements and acceptance tests. We interviewed twenty practitioners from seventeen business units in fifteen companies to investigate the companies' practices for writing, maintaining and linking requirements and acceptance test documentation. The study yields interesting and partially unexpected results. For example, we had expected that tests would be more extensively documented than requirements, while we found a strong linear correlation between the number of requirements and tests in our sample. We also found that technical people are usually not involved in the requirements engineering activities, which often results in misunderstood or underestimated requirements. Acceptance tests are written, in many cases, based on requirements that are not necessarily detailed enough. Also, acceptance tests are not regularly maintained, which occasionally results in confusing features and bugs.",10.1109/RE.2016.37,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765517,,12,IEEE Conferences,,S.

Managing Requirements Change the Informal Way: When Saying ‘No’ is Not an Option,,"School of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand; Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia; The University of Auckland, Auckland, Auckland, NZ; School of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand",05-Dec-16,"Software has always been considered as malleable. Changes to software requirements are inevitable during the development process. Despite many software engineering advances over several decades, requirements changes are a source of project risk, particularly when businesses and technologies are evolving rapidly. Although effectively managing requirements changes is a critical aspect of software engineering, conceptions of requirements change in the literature and approaches to their management in practice still seem rudimentary. The overall goal of this study is to better understand the process of requirements change management. We present findings from an exploratory case study of requirements change management in a globally distributed setting. In this context we noted a contrast with the traditional models of requirements change. In theory, change control policies and formal processes are considered as a natural strategy to deal with requirements changes. Yet we observed that ""informal requirements changes"" (InfRc) were pervasive and unavoidable. Our results reveal an equally 'natural' informal change management process that is required to handle InfRc in parallel. We present a novel model of requirements change which, we argue, better represents the phenomenon and more realistically incorporates both the informal and formal types of change.",10.1109/RE.2016.64,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765518,Informal requirements change;scope creep;requirements management;requirements change management,8,IEEE Conferences,,W.

NANE: Identifying Misuse Cases Using Temporal Norm Enactments,,"Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA; Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA; Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA",05-Dec-16,"Recent data breaches in domains such as healthcare where confidentiality of data is crucial indicate that breaches often originate from misuses, not only from vulnerabilities in the technical (software or hardware) architecture. Current requirements engineering (RE) approaches determine what access control mechanisms are needed to protect sensitive resources (assets). However, current RE approaches inadequately characterize how a user is expected to interact with others in relation to the relevant assets. Consequently, a requirements analyst cannot readily identify misuses by legitimate users. We adopt social norms as a natural, formal means of characterizing user interactions whereby potential misuses map to norm violations. Our research goal is to help analysts identify misuse cases by formal reasoning about norm enactments. We propose Nane, a formal framework for identifying such misuse cases using a semiautomated process.

Supporting Requirements Elicitation by Tool-Supported Video Analysis,,"Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany; Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany; Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany",05-Dec-16,"Workshops are an established technique for requirements elicitation. A lot of information is revealed during a workshop, which is generally captured via textual minutes. The scribe suffers from a cognitive overload due to the difficulty of gathering all information, listening and writing at the same time. Video recording is used as additional option to capture more information, including non-verbal gestures. Since a workshop can take several hours, the recorded video will be long and may be disconnected from the scribe's notes. Therefore, the weak and unclear structure of the video complicates the access to the recorded information, for example in subsequent requirements engineering activities. We propose the combination of textual minutes and video with a software tool. Our objective is connecting textual notes with the corresponding part of the video. By highlighting relevant sections of a video and attaching notes that summarize those sections, a more useful structure can be achieved. This structure allows an easy and fast access to the relevant information and their corresponding video context. Thus, a scribe's overload can be mitigated and further use of a video can be simplified. Tool-supported analysis of such an enriched video can facilitate the access to all communicated information of a workshop. This allows an easier elicitation of high-quality requirements. We performed a preliminary evaluation of our approach in an experimental set-up with 12 participants.

Furthermore, the task must often be performed repeatedly throughout early phases of the project. In this paper we first explore the effort needed to manually build a high-level domain model capturing the functional components. We then present MaRK (Mining Requirements Knowledge), which identifies and retrieves the documents containing descriptions of functional components in the domain model. Domain analysts can use this information to to specify requirements. We introduce and evaluate an algorithm which ranks domain documents according to their relevance to a component and then highlights sections of text which are likely to contain requirements-related information.

It compares traditional linguistic machine learning features, such as ""bag of words"", with more advanced features, such as subject-action-object, and evaluates combinations of machine learning features derived from the natural language and features taken from the issue tracking system meta-data. Our investigation shows that some combinations of machine learning features derived from natural language and the issue tracking system meta-data outperform traditional approaches. We show that issues or data fields (e.g. descriptions or comments), which contain software feature requests, can be identified reasonably well, but hardly the exact sentence.

Acquiring Creative Requirements from the Crowd: Understanding the Influences of Personality and Creative Potential in Crowd RE,,"Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA; Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA; Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA",05-Dec-16,"As a creative discipline, Requirements Engineering (RE), lends importance to understanding the associated human factors. Crowd RE, the approach of acquiring requirements from members of the public-the so-called crowd-emphasizes human factors further. We investigate how human personality and creative potential influence a requirement acquisition task. These factors are of specific importance to Crowd RE because (1) crowd workers are generally not trained in RE, and (2) a key motivation in engaging them is to benefit from their creativity. We propose a sequential Crowd RE process, where workers in one stage review requirements from the previous stage and produce additional requirements. To reduce potential information overload in this process, we propose strategies for selecting requirements from one stage to expose to workers in later stages. We conducted a study on Amazon Mechanical Turk tasking 300 workers with creating requirements via the above sequential process (in the domain of smart home applications for concreteness) and tasking an additional 300 workers to rate the creativity (novelty and usefulness) of those requirements. Our findings offer insights on how to carry out Crowd RE effectively. First, we find that a crowd worker's (1) creative potential, and personality traits of openness and conscientiousness have significant positive influence on the novelty of the worker's ideas, and (2) personality traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness have significant positive influence, but extraversion has significant negative influence on the usefulness of the worker's ideas. Second, we find that exposing a worker to ideas from previous workers cognitively stimulates the worker to produce creative ideas.

The belief that a software system can be developed without privacy being an integral concept, or that a privacy policy is sufficient as requirements or compliance check is at best dangerous for the users, customers and business involved. While requirements frameworks exist, the specialisation of these into the privacy domain have not been made in such a manner that they unify both the legal and engineering domains. In order to achieve this one must develop ontological structures to aid communication between these domains, provide a commonly acceptable semantics and a framework by which requirements expressed at different levels of abstractness can be linked together and support refinement. An effect of this is to almost completely remove the terms 'personal data' and 'PII' from common usage and force a deeper understanding of the data and information being processed. Once such a structure is in place - even if just partially or sparsely populated - provides a formal framework by which not only requirements can be obtained, their application (or not) be justified and a proper risk analysis made. This has further advantages in that privacy requirements and their potential implementations can be explored through the software development process and support ideas such as agile methods and 'DevOps' rather than being an 'add-on' exercise - a privacy impact assessment - poorly executed at inappropriate times.",10.1109/RE.2016.59,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765535,Privacy Engineering;Privacy;Requirements;Ontologies;Semantics,8,IEEE Conferences,,I.

Model-Based Simulation of Legal Requirements: Experience from Tax Policy Simulation,,"Reliability and Trust, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Reliability and Trust, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Reliability and Trust, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg",05-Dec-16,"Using models for expressing legal requirements is now commonplace in Requirements Engineering. Models of legal requirements, on the one hand, facilitate communication between software engineers and legal experts, and on the other hand, provide a basis for systematic and automated analysis. The most prevalent application of legal requirements models is for checking the compliance of software systems with laws and regulations. In this experience paper, we explore a complementary application of legal requirements models, namely simulation. We observe that, in domains such as taxation, the same models that underlie legal compliance analysis bring important added value by enabling simulation. Concretely, this paper reports on the model-based simulation of selected legal requirements (policies) derived from Luxembourg's Income Tax Law. The simulation scenario considered in the paper is aimed at analyzing the impact of a current tax law reform proposal in Luxembourg. We describe our approach for simulation along with empirical results demonstrating the feasibility and accuracy of the approach.

A Two-Stage Inspection Method for Automotive Software Systems and Its Practical Applications,,"Electronics Platform R&D Div., DENSO CORPORATION, Kariya, Japan; Department of Software Engineering, Nanzan University, Nagoya, Japan",05-Dec-16,"Requirements to automotive software is ever increasing its size and complexity due to rapid advancement of internet connection and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). To assure the quality of software requirements specification (SRS) is a challenge. The quality assurance of SRS mostly relies on peer-review, which is error prone. To improve the quality of SRS, numerous techniques have been proposed, including a variety of review and inspection techniques. However, previous works indicate the diversity and confusion of requirements at different abstraction levels in automotive SRS makes it difficult to apply conventional review techniques. We propose a two-stage inspection method in order to separate perspectives in inspection. We define the reference SRS and the associated document quality characteristics, and mapping method from the reference SRS to multiple domain SRSs. We also develop a method to quantitatively measure the document quality of an SRS by third-party inspection. The contributions of this research include: 1) proposal of two-stage inspection process, 2) method of mapping the reference automotive SRS to project SRSs in multiple different product domains, 3) method for quantitative measurement and benchmark of SRS quality, 4) evaluation of the effectiveness of the method through applications to five actual automotive SRSs in four different product domains, and 5) adequacy validation of the IEEE Std. 830-1998 SRS template for automotive SRSs.",10.1109/RE.2016.55,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765537,Software Requirements Specifications;Quality Characteristics;Inspection;Automotive Software,1,IEEE Conferences,,A.

RAMP: Requirements Authors Mentoring Program,,"Intel Corporation, USA; Intel Corporation, USA",05-Dec-16,"In a previous case study and paper, data was presented indicating that requirements training alone was not sufficient to achieve a high-quality requirements set. Mentoring of requirements authors by a requirements Subject Matter Expert (SME) was necessary. The requirements SME provided constructive and detailed feedback on defects in the requirements and then assisted the author with rewrites to remove them. This iterative process produced high-quality requirements but only after multiple revisions of requirements sets. The technique works well if there are only a few authors. However, what happens when there are dozens or hundreds of requirements authors? One requirements SME cannot possibly mentor that many authors. This paper presents the answer to this problem: the Requirements Authors Mentoring Program or RAMP. RAMP pairs a network of trained, site-based requirements SMEs with requirements authors.

Towards Improved Requirements Engineering with SysML and the User Requirements Notation,,"University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada; University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada; University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada; University of Ottawa and IRHM, Ottawa, Canada; IRIT and IUT de Blagnac, Toulouse, France",05-Dec-16,"The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is a popular and standardized UML profile for systems engineering applications. In addition to seven conventional UML diagram types, SysML supports requirement diagrams and tables that can be used to capture requirements, their attributes, and their relationships. However, several important concepts such as goals and contributions are not predefined in SysML, hindering the reasoning about tradeoffs and adaptation, especially in emerging socio-cyber-physical systems such as smart cities. In this paper, we provide a preliminary investigation of different ways of combining SysML with the User Requirements Notation (URN), a standard that focuses on the modeling and analysis of goals and scenarios. We argue that SysML and URN are complementary and synergistic, and that their combination enables new requirements modeling, analysis, and management opportunities for new types of systems.

Requirements Engineering as Innovation Journalism: A Research Preview,,"SERL-Sweden, Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden; Qualität & Informatik, Geroldswil, Switzerland; Zuehlke Engineering AG, Schlieren, Switzerland",05-Dec-16,"The successful launch of an innovation project depends on an attractive vision and how well the vision is supported by the complementary capabilities of the consortium partners that want to cooperate to realize the vision. Alas, for an innovator the search for the right partners and visions can be lengthy and difficult. Even though the analysis of context and problem, the identification of stakeholders, the analysis of stakeholder goals and techno-logical capabilities, and the definition of requirements belong to the cornerstones of requirements engineering, this requirements engineering problem has hardly been explored so far. In an attempt to avoid re-invention of well-tried solutions, we discovered journalism as a discipline that, as a rich body of methodical knowledge, may act as a source for the guidance of how a requirements engineer may support the launch of innovation projects. In the role of a journalist, the requirements engineer makes partners and their capabilities visible and thereby allows the parties to identify each other and meet. The transparency that develops between the parties becomes an instrument for consortia to emerge and to eventually answer calls for innovation with appropriate visions for innovation projects. This paper introduces the problem of initiating innovation projects and describes the potential role of journalism as a metaphor for addressing the problem. The paper also describes our plans in designing an innovation journalism approach that we hope will enable requirements engineers to increase innovation potential and ease the launch of projects that bring about these innovations.",10.1109/RE.2016.57,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765540,innovation;journalism;stakeholder discovery;vision-building;design sciences research,2,IEEE Conferences,,S.

Relationships can show, for example, that one requirement refines another, that some are in conflict with others, that they are more or less desirable, and so on. Various software tools have been proposed over the years as a support to doing GRM, some capable of performing computations over diagrams, such as searching for text strings, or determining if a requirement is satisfied (and how much). We present yet another tool, available at AnalyticGraph.com. The tool departs from much of prior work in the following ways. (i) The tool is a web application, is available on-demand, and requires no installation of specialized software. (ii) Each model made with the tool gets its own permanent and unique URL, so that models can be linked in research papers.

Proposition of iterative and evolutionary approaches was triggered by the realization that requirements engineering is not confined to the initial phases of software development only. With this shift of perspective, requirements engineering has become more or less a continuous process in software development lifecycles. We believe that existing requirements engineering approaches and associated tooling leave a room for improvement in putting 'continuity' into practice. A continuous requirements engineering methodology needs to take into account different concerns of all the stakeholders involved in the process. Approaches like KAOS bring the multi-view nature of requirements modeling in focus by using different views for goal, responsibility, object and operation modeling. We argue that a multi-view approach, maintaining a dynamic link between the requirement models and multiple sources of requirements, can offer a better support for continuous requirements engineering methodology.

However, often such user involvement is difficult to achieve, especially in scientific settings where finding enough participants with the needed background knowledge is far from trivial. In this paper we propose the idea of creating a searchable marketplace of visual elements, in which designers could share and exchange elements of visual notations.

But for any social software to be successful, it must be used by a sizeable portion of its intended user community. Usage requirements are usually referred to as Acceptance Requirements and they have been studied in the literature both for general technology as well as software. Operationalization techniques for such requirements often consist of making a game out of software usage where users are rewarded/penalized depending onthe degree of their participation. The game may be competitive or non-competitive, depending on the anticipated personality traits of intended users. Making a game out of usage is often referred to as Gamification, and gamification has attracted huge attention in the literature for the past few years because it offers a novelapproach to software technology usage. This paper proposes a generic framework for designing gamified solutions for acceptance requirements. The framework consists of a generic acceptance goal model that characterizes the problem space by capturing possible refinements for acceptance requirements, and a generic gamification model that capturespossible gamified operationalizations of acceptance requirements.

Empowering Requirements Elicitation Interviews with Vocal and Biofeedback Analysis,,"Kennesaw State University, Marietta, GA, USA; Kennesaw State University, Marietta, GA, USA; Kennesaw State University, Marietta, GA, USA; ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy",05-Dec-16,"Interviews with stakeholders are the most commonly used elicitation technique, as they are considered one of the most effective ways to transfer knowledge between requirements analysts and customers. During these interviews, ambiguity is a major obstacle for knowledge transfer, as it can lead to incorrectly understood needs and domain aspects and may ultimately result in poorly defined requirements. To address this issue, previous work focused on how ambiguity is perceived on the analyst side, i.e., when the analyst perceives an expression of the customer as ambiguous. However, this work did not consider how ambiguity can affect customers, i.e., when questions from the analyst are perceived as ambiguous. Since customers are not in general trained to cope with ambiguity, it is important to provide analysts with techniques that can help them to identify these situations. To support the analysts in this task, we propose to explore the relation between a perceived ambiguity on the customer side, and changes in the voice and bio parameters of that customer. To realize our idea, we plan to (1) study how changes in the voice and bio parameters can be correlated to the levels of stress, confusion, and uncertainty of an interviewee and, ultimately, to ambiguity and (2) investigate the application of modern voice analyzers and wristbands in the context of customer-analyst interviews. To show the feasibility of the idea, in this paper we present the result of our first step in this direction:an overview of different voice analyzers and wristbands that can collect bio parameters and their application in similar contexts.

Towards a Regulator-Oriented Regulatory Intelligence Framework,,"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada",05-Dec-16,"With regulations influencing almost all societal interactions, divergent views about their relevance and performance exist today. In consideration of the time and cost implication involved in complying, regulated parties often complain of overregulation. Governments, motivated to ensure the safety, security and prosperity of their communities, insist on effective and efficient regulations and advocate for more. Additionally, citizens and interest groups advocate for more or fewer regulations depending on perceived benefits to them. This scenario puts pressure on regulators mandated to administer regulations. They are required to be transparent and accountable in showing the performance of regulations while accommodating the concerns of different stakeholders involved. In this regard, this doctoral research proposes a framework that regulators can use to show the performance of their regulations through modeling and measuring regulations and evaluating and reporting their outcomes.

Towards an Approach to Stimulate Architectural Thinking during Requirements Engineering Phase,,"University of Twente, Netherlands",05-Dec-16,"[Context/Motivation:] The major role of a software architect in the software development life cycle is to design an architectural solution that satisfies the functional and non-functional requirements of the system to the fullest extent possible. However, the details they need to make informed architectural decisions are often missing from the software requirements specifications. Architects therefore either make assumptions or go back to the business analysts for clarifications or conduct additional stakeholder interviews. All of these result in potential project delays. [Question/Problem:] There is very little known about how architects gather this missing information that is crucial to architectural decision-making. Further, there is dearth of knowledge on how we can leverage the requirements analysis phase by empowering business analysts to gather architecturally significant information pertinent to a given requirement. [Principal ideas / Results:] Based on qualitative interview study with software architects from large organisations, this research will (a) investigate how architects cope with missing information in real-world large scale projects and (b) leverage the knowledge of experienced software architects and make it available to business analysts so that they are equipped to elicit a more complete set of requirements that feed sufficient information into the architecture design process.

Quality-Impact Assessment of Software Systems,,"Software Engineering Research Lab (SERL-SWEDEN), Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden",05-Dec-16,"Runtime monitoring and assessment of software products, features, and requirements allow product managers and requirement engineers to verify the implemented features or requirements, and validate the user acceptance. Gaining insight into software quality and impact of the quality on user facilitates interpretation of quality against users' acceptance and vice versa. The insight also expedites root cause analysis and fast evolution in the case of threatening the health and sustainability of the software. Several studies have proposed automated monitoring solutions and assessment, however, none of the studies introduces a solution for a joint assessment of software quality and quality impact on users. In this research, we study the relation between software quality and the impact of quality on Quality of Experience (QoE) of users to support the assessment of software products, features, and requirements. We propose a Quality-Impact assessment method based on a joint analysis of software quality and user feedback. As an application of the proposed method in requirement engineering, the joint analysis guides verification and validation of functional and quality requirements as well as capturing new requirements. The study follows a design science approach to design Quality-Impact method artifact. The Quality-Impact method has been already designed and validated in the first design cycle. However, next design cycles will contribute to clarify problems of the initial design, refine and validate the proposed method.

Evaluation of Requirements Models,,"Department of Computer Science Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa",05-Dec-16,"Requirements Engineering (RE) approaches, following paradigms such as goal-oriented [1] or scenario-based [2], provide expressive model elements for requirements elicitation and analysis. However, these approaches are still struggling when it comes to managing the quality of their models. Problems in quality can cause difficulties in anaging and understanding requirements, which in turn leads to increased development costs. The models' quality should then be a permanent concern. We propose a quantitative assessment of the goal-oriented and scenario-based models' quality, namely its complexity, completeness, appropriateness recognizability, understandability and learnability. To this end, we propose a combination of techniques to be applied to the RE models, the modelling process, and the models' notation. We are going to define metrics about the models, through the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach, and incorporate them in a common evaluation framework that helps in the requirements modelling process. The quality of the RE models, the modelling process and the model's notation will be measured by collecting biometric data from stakeholders, by using eye-tracking devices, electroencephalography (EEG) scanners, and electro-dermal activity (EDA) scanners. Furthermore, we will collect metrics about the model during the modelling process, and the subjective opinion of stakeholders about the usage of these models, through questionnaires like NASA TLX [4] (which measures perceived effort while working on tasks). All metrics and biometrics are going to be theoretically and experimentally evaluated, through a set of case studies and experiments with different types of participants (including researchers, practitioners and students).",10.1109/RE.2016.28,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765561,requirements models;quality evaluation;metrics;biometrics,3,IEEE Conferences,,C.

Exact Analysis for Next Release Problem,,"CREST, University College, London, United Kingdom",05-Dec-16,"In software engineering, determining the set of requirements to implement in the next release is a critical foundation for the success of a project.

In the meantime, uncertainty is characterised by incomplete understanding. It is inevitable in the early phase of requirements engineering, and could lead to unsound requirement decisions. To ease the impact of uncertainty in the software development process, it is important to provide techniques that explicitly manage uncertainty in requirements analysis and optimisation. This proposed research aims to provide a decision support framework for analysing uncertainty in requirements selection and optimisation. The proposed research involves three stages. Firstly, a simulation optimisation technique is introduced to model requirements uncertainty in requirements optimisation. Then, an exact technique is designed to eliminate the algorithmic uncertainty.

Definition of a Behavior-Driven Model for Requirements Specification and Testing of Interactive Systems,,"ICS-IRIT Université Paul Sabatier-Toulouse III, Toulouse, France",05-Dec-16,"In a user-centered development process, artifacts are aimed to evolve in iterative cycles until they meet users' requirements and then become the final product. Every cycle gives the opportunity to revise the design and to introduce new requirements which might affect the specification of artifacts that have been set in former development phases. Testing the consistency of multiple artifacts used to develop interactive systems every time that a new requirement is introduced it is a cumbersome and time consuming activity, especially if it should be done manually. For that we propose an approach based on Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to support the automated assessment of artifacts along the development process of interactive systems. In order to prevent that test should be written to every type of artifact, we investigate the use of ontologies for specifying the test once and then run it in all artifacts sharing the ontological concepts.",10.1109/RE.2016.12,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765563,Automated Requirements Checking;Behavior-Driven Development;Ontological Modeling;Prototyping;Multi-Artifact Testing,6,IEEE Conferences,,T.

The Generation and Evolution of Adaptation Rules in Requirements Driven Self-Adaptive Systems,,"Institute of Software, Peking University, Beijing, China",05-Dec-16,"One of the challenges in self-adaptive software systems is to make adaptation plans in response to possible changes. A good plan mechanism shall have the capability of: 1) selecting the most appropriate adaptation actions in response to changes both in the environment and requirements, 2) making adaptation decisions efficiently to react timely to arising situations at run-time. In existing approaches for plan process, rule-based adaptation provides an efficient offline planning method. However, it can react neither to changeable requirements nor to unexpected environment changes. On the contrary, goal-based and utility-based approaches provide online planning mechanisms, which can well handle a highly uncertain environment with dynamically changing requirements and environment. However, online adaptation decision making is often computationally expensive and may encounter less-efficiency problems. The aim of our research is to improve the planning processin requirements driven self-adaptive systems, i.e., enabling the self-adaptive system to efficiently make adaptation plans to cope with the dynamic environment and changeable requirements. To achieve such advantages, we propose a solution to enhance the traditional rule-based adaptation with a rule generation and a rule evolution process, so that the proposed approach can maintain the advantages of efficient planning process while being enhanced with the capability of dealing with runtime uncertainty.",10.1109/RE.2016.18,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765565,requirement driven self-adaptation;adaptation plan;reinforcement learning;case-based reasoning,6,IEEE Conferences,,T.

A manual analysis of how a change to one requirement impacts other requirements is time-consuming and presents a challenge for large requirements specifications. We propose an approach based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing the impact of change in Natural Language (NL) requirements. Our focus on NL requirements is motivated by the prevalent use of these requirements, particularly in industry. Our approach automatically detects and takes into account the phrasal structure of requirements statements. We argue about the importance of capturing the conditions under which change should propagate to enable more accurate change impact analysis.

Ambiguity as a resource to disclose tacit knowledge,,"ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy; Kennesaw State University, Georgia, USA; ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy",05-Nov-15,"Interviews are the most common and effective means to perform requirements elicitation and support knowledge transfer between a customer and a requirements analyst. Ambiguity in communication is often perceived as a major obstacle for knowledge transfer, which could lead to unclear and incomplete requirements documents. In this paper, we analyse the role of ambiguity in requirements elicitation interviews. To this end, we have performed a set of customer-analyst interviews to observe how ambiguity occurs during requirements elicitation. From this direct experience, we have observed that ambiguity is a multi-dimensional cognitive phenomenon with a dominant pragmatic facet, and we have defined a phenomenological framework to describe the different types of ambiguity in interviews. We have also discovered that, rather than an obstacle, the occurrence of an ambiguity is often a resource for discovering tacit knowledge.

An information theoretic approach for extracting and tracing non-functional requirements,,"Computer Science and Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA",05-Nov-15,"Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are high-level quality constraints that a software system should exhibit. Detecting such constraints early in the process is critical for the stability of software architectural design. However, due to their pervasive nature, and the lack of robust modeling and documentation techniques, NFRs are often overlooked during the requirements elicitation phase. Realizing such constraints at later stages of the development process often leads to architecture erosion and poor traceability. Motivated by these observations, we propose an unsupervised, computationally efficient, and scalable approach for extracting and tracing NFRs in software systems. Based on main assumptions of the cluster hypothesis and information theory, the proposed approach exploits the semantic knowledge embedded in the textual content of requirements specifications to discover, classify, and trace high-level software quality constraints imposed by the system's functional features. Three experimental systems are used to conduct the experimental analysis in this paper. Results show that the proposed approach can discover software NFRs with an average accuracy of 73%, enabling these NFRs to be traced to their implementations with accuracy levels adequate for practical applications.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320406,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320406,,22,IEEE Conferences,,A.

Goal and Preference Identification through natural language,,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada; School of Information Technology, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada",05-Nov-15,"Goal models allow efficient representation of stakeholder goals and alternative ways by which these can be satisfied. Preferences over goals in the goal model are then used to specify criteria for selecting alternatives that fit specific contexts, situations and strategies. Given such preferences, automated reasoning tools allow for efficient exploration of such alternatives. Nevertheless, to be amenable to such automated processing, goals and preferences need to be specified in a formal language, making automated processing inaccessible to the very bearers of goals and preferences, i.e., the stakeholders. We combine natural language processing techniques to allow specification of preferences through natural language statements. The natural language statement is first matched through regular expressions to distinguish between the preference component and the goal component. The former is then mapped to a preferential strength measure, while the latter is used to identify the relevant goal in the goal model through statistical semantic similarity techniques. The result constitutes a formal representation that can be used for alternatives analysis. In this way, stakeholders can access advanced goal reasoning techniques through simple natural language preference expressions, facilitating their decision making in various requirements analysis contexts. An experimental evaluation with human participants shows that the proposed system is of substantial precision and that a mapping from natural preferential verbalizations to predefined preferential strength labels is possible through sampling from crowds.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320408,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320408,requirements engineering;goal modeling;natural language;decision analysis;preference analysis,5,IEEE Conferences,,F.

However, existing approaches do not adequately consider the characteristics of SoS: different types of requirements exist at different levels and across different systems; requirements are maintained by different stakeholders; and systems are implemented using diverse technologies. This paper describes a three-dimensional requirements monitoring model (RMM) for SoS providing the following contributions: (i) our approach allows modeling the monitoring scopes of requirements with respect to the SoS architecture; (ii) it employs event models to abstract from different technologies and systems to be monitored; and (iii) it supports instantiating the RMM at runtime depending on the actual SoS configuration. To evaluate the feasibility of our approach we created a RMM for a real-world SoS from the automation software domain. We evaluated the model by instantiating it using an existing monitoring framework and a simulator running parts of this SoS. The results indicate that the model is sufficiently expressive to support monitoring SoS requirements of a directed SoS. It further facilitates diagnosis by discovering violations of requirements across different levels and systems in realistic monitoring scenarios.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320412,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320412,System of systems;requirements monitoring,14,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Handling knowledge uncertainty in risk-based requirements engineering,,"Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Université catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Université catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium",05-Nov-15,"Requirements engineers are faced with multiple sources of uncertainty. In particular, the extent to which the identified software requirements and environment assumptions are adequate and sufficiently complete is uncertain; the extent to which they will be satisfied in the system-to-be is uncertain; and the extent to which obstacles to their satisfaction will occur is uncertain. The resolution of such domain-level uncertainty requires estimations of the likelihood that those different types of situations may or may not occur. However, the extent to which the resulting estimates are accurate is uncertain as well. This meta-level uncertainty limits current risk-based methods for requirements engineering. The paper introduces a quantitative approach for managing it. An earlier formal framework for probabilistic goals and obstacles is extended to explicitly cope with uncertainties about estimates of likelihoods of fine-grained obstacles to goal satisfaction. Such estimates are elicited from multiple sources and combined in order to reduce their uncertainty margins. The combined estimates and their uncertainties are up-propagated through obstacle refinement trees and then through the system's goal model. Two metrics are introduced for measuring problematic uncertainties. When applied to the probability distributions obtained by up-propagation to the top-level goals, the metrics allow critical leaf obstacles with most problematic uncertainty margins to be highlighted. The proposed approach is evaluated on excerpts from a real ambulance dispatching system.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320413,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320413,obstacle analysis;risk assessment;probabilistic goals;requirements completeness;uncertainty management;quantitative reasoning;goal-oriented requirements engineering,24,IEEE Conferences,,A.

"Bug report, feature request, or simply praise? On automatically classifying app reviews",,"University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",05-Nov-15,"App stores like Google Play and Apple AppStore have over 3 Million apps covering nearly every kind of software and service. Billions of users regularly download, use, and review these apps. Recent studies have shown that reviews written by the users represent a rich source of information for the app vendors and the developers, as they include information about bugs, ideas for new features, or documentation of released features. This paper introduces several probabilistic techniques to classify app reviews into four types: bug reports, feature requests, user experiences, and ratings. For this we use review metadata such as the star rating and the tense, as well as, text classification, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis techniques. We conducted a series of experiments to compare the accuracy of the techniques and compared them with simple string matching. We found that metadata alone results in a poor classification accuracy. When combined with natural language processing, the classification precision got between 70-95% while the recall between 80-90%. Multiple binary classifiers outperformed single multiclass classifiers. Our results impact the design of review analytics tools which help app vendors, developers, and users to deal with the large amount of reviews, filter critical reviews, and assign them to the appropriate stakeholders.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320414,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320414,,280,IEEE Conferences,,W.

Exposing the susceptibility of off-nominal behaviors in reactive system requirements,,"Computer Science Department, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA; Computer Science Department, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA",05-Nov-15,"Requirements are typically specified on the assumption that the system's operating environment will behave in what is considered to be an expected and nominal manner. When gathering requirements, one concern is whether the requirements are too incomplete to account for every possible, unintended, off-nominal behavior (ONB) that the operating environment can create in the system. In this paper, we present a semi-automated approach, based on the causal component model (CCM), which can expose, within a set of requirements, whether ONBs can result in undesired system states. We demonstrate how the CCM approach exposes and helps address potential off-nominal behavior problems in a set of requirements that represents a real-world product.

When systems are composed of multiple machines, configurations, and software components that interact with each other, risk perception must account for the composition of security requirements. In this paper, we report on how changes to security requirements affect analysts risk perceptions and their decisions about how to modify the requirements to reach adequate security levels. We conducted two user surveys of 174 participants wherein participants assess security levels across 64 factorial vignettes. We analyzed the survey results using multi-level modeling to test for the effect of security requirements composition on participants' overall security adequacy ratings and on their ratings of individual requirements. We accompanied this analysis with grounded analysis of elicited requirements aimed at lowering the security risk. Our results suggest that requirements composition affects experts' adequacy ratings on security requirements. In addition, we identified three categories of requirements modifications, called refinements, replacements and reinforcements, and we measured how these categories compare with overall perceived security risk. Finally, we discuss the future impact of our work in security requirements assessment practice.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320417,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320417,user study;vignettes;factor surveys;security requirements;requirements elicitation,10,IEEE Conferences,,H.

However, a stakeholder's beliefs may not be consistent with the goals of all stakeholders of a system being constructed. Such belief-goal inconsistencies could manifest themselves as conflicting goals of the system to be. We propose Arg-ACH, a novel approach for capturing inconsistencies between stakeholders' goals and beliefs, and resolving goal conflicts. Arg-ACH employs a hybrid of (1) the analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH), a structured analytic technique, for systematically eliciting stakeholders' goals and beliefs, and (2) rational argumentation for determining belief-goal inconsistencies to resolve conflicts. Arg-ACH treats conflicting goals as hypotheses that compete with each other and the winning hypothesis as a goal of the system to be. Arg-ACH systematically captures the trail of a requirements engineer's thought process in resolving conflicts. We evaluated Arg-ACH via a study in which 20 subjects applied Arg-ACH or ACH to resolve goal conflicts in a sociotechnical system concerning national security. We found that Arg-ACH is superior to ACH with respect to completeness and coverage of belief search; length of belief chaining; ease of use; explicitness of the assumptions made; and repeatability of conclusions across subjects.

Detecting repurposing and over-collection in multi-party privacy requirements specifications,,"Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, US; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, US; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, US",05-Nov-15,"Mobile and web applications increasingly leverage service-oriented architectures in which developers integrate third-party services into end user applications. This includes identity management, mapping and navigation, cloud storage, and advertising services, among others. While service reuse reduces development time, it introduces new privacy and security risks due to data repurposing and over-collection as data is shared among multiple parties who lack transparency into third-party data practices. To address this challenge, we propose new techniques based on Description Logic (DL) for modeling multiparty data flow requirements and verifying the purpose specification and collection and use limitation principles, which are prominent privacy properties found in international standards and guidelines. We evaluate our techniques in an empirical case study that examines the data practices of the Waze mobile application and three of their service providers: Facebook Login, Amazon Web Services (a cloud storage provider), and Flurry.com (a popular mobile analytics and advertising platform). The study results include detected conflicts and violations of the principles as well as two patterns for balancing privacy and data use flexibility in requirements specifications.

A quality model for the systematic assessment of requirements traceability,,"Software Systems/Process Informatics Group, Technische UUniversität Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany; Software Systems/Process Informatics Group, Technische UUniversität Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany",05-Nov-15,"Traceability is an important quality of software requirements and allows to describe and follow their life throughout a development project. The importance of traceable requirements is reflected by the fact that requirements standards, safety regulations, and maturity models explicitly demand for it. In practice, traceability is created and maintained by humans, which make mistakes. In result, existing traces are potentially of dubious quality but serve as the foundation for high impact development decisions. We found in previous studies that practitioners miss clear guidance on how to systematically assess the quality of existing traces. In this paper, we review the elements involved in establishing traceability in a development project and derive a quality model that specifies per element the acceptable state (Traceability Gate) and unacceptable deviations (Traceability Problem) from this state. We describe and formally define how both, the acceptable states and the unacceptable deviations can be detected in order to enable practitioners to systematically assess their project's traceability. We evaluated the proposed model through an expert survey. The participating experts considered the quality model to be complete and attested that its quality criteria are of high relevance. We further found that the experts weight the occurrence of different traceability problems with different criticality.

It is a mobile tool for model-based sketching of free-form diagrams that allows the definition and re-use of diagramming notations on the fly. The latest version of the tool, called FlexiSketch Team, supports collaboration with multiple tablets and an electronic whiteboard, such that several users can work simultaneously on the same model sketch. In this paper we present an exploratory study about how novice and experienced engineers sketch and define ad-hoc notations collaboratively in early requirements elicitation sessions when supported by our tool.

Inherent characteristics of traceability artifacts less is more,,"Computer Science, University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA; GIGL, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Canada; GIGL, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Canada; GIGL, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Canada",05-Nov-15,"This paper describes ongoing work to characterize the inherent ease or “traceability” with which a textual artifact can be traced using an automated technique. Software traceability approaches use varied measures to build models that automatically recover links between pairs of natural language documents. Thus far, most of the approaches use a single-step model, such as logistic regression, to identify new trace links. However, such approaches require a large enough training set of both true and false trace links. Yet, the former are by far in the minority, which reduces the performance of such models. Therefore, this paper formulates the problem of identifying trace links as the problem of finding, for a given logistic regression model, the subsets of links in the training set giving the best accuracy (in terms of G-metric) on a test set. Using hill climbing with random restart for subset selection, we found that, for the ChangeStyle dataset, we can classify links with a precision of up to 40% and a recall of up to 66% using a training set as small as one true candidate link (out of 33) and 41 false links. To get better performance and learn the best possible logistic regression classifier, we must “discard” links in the trace dataset that increase noise to avoid learning with links that are not representative. This preliminary work is promising because it shows that few correct examples may perform better than several poor ones. It also shows which inherent characteristics of the artifacts make them good candidates to learn efficient traceability models automatically, i.e., it reveals their traceability.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320422,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320422,Traceability;machine learning;model;logistic regression;artifact characteristics,3,IEEE Conferences,,J.

The links are then used to support a range of software engineering activities including impact analysis, compliance verification, and safety inspections. For traceability to effectively support these activities it is important for the meaning and rationale of each link to be clearly communicated. It is often insuficient to know that one artifact satisfies, realizes, or complies to another. Instead, it is important to know why and how it does so.

However, in practice maintaining consistency at all times is an intractable problem. Accordingly, recent paradigms for inconsistency management acknowledge that it is sometimes desirable to tolerate inconsistency, e.g. to allow distributed teamwork and prevent premature commitment to design decisions. However, a successful adoption of inconsistency managment paradigms in industry depends highly on the human factor: intolerant attitudes of practitioners toward inconsistency may pose significant barriers to a wider acceptance of these paradigms.

Using real options to manage Technical Debt in Requirements Engineering,,"University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, CA; Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada",05-Nov-15,"Despite the importance of Requirements Engineering (RE) for the success of software products, most of the requirements decisions such as requirements specification and prioritization are still ad hoc and depend upon the managers' preferences and the trade-offs they make. The Technical Debt (TD) metaphor looks into the trade-offs between short term and long-term goals in software development projects that may lead to increased cost in the future. This problem is mainly due to the lack of a systematic and well-defined approach to manage the high level of uncertainty in requirements decisions. In this paper, we propose to apply the real options thinking to develop a quantitative method for managing requirements decisions under uncertainty and, more specifically for managing requirements debt in software development projects. A real option is a right without an obligation to make a specific future decision depending on how uncertainty resolves.

By treating the system under construction as a black box, the environment is typically documented as a number of assumptions, based on which a set of environmental safety requirements will be elicited. However, it is not a trivial task in practice to capture the environmental assumptions to elicit safety requirements. The lack of certain assumptions or too strict assumptions will either result in incomplete environmental safety requirements or waste many efforts on eliciting incorrect requirements. Moreover, the variety of operating environment for an SCS will further complicate the task, since the captured assumptions are at risk of invalidity, and consequently the elicited requirements need to be revisited to ensure safety has not been compromised by the change. This short paper presents an on-going work aiming to 1) systematically organize the knowledge of system operating environment and, 2) facilitate the elicitation of environmental safety requirements. We propose an ontological approach to achieve the objectives. In particular, we utilize conceptual ontologies to organize the environment knowledge in terms of relevant environment concepts, relations among them and axioms.

Machine learning at support of early assessment,,"Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy; Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy; Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy; Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy",05-Nov-15,"A relevant activity in the requirements engineering process consists in the identification, assessment and management of potential risks, which can prevent the system-to-be from meeting stakeholder needs. However, risk analysis techniques are often time- and resource- consuming activities, which may introduce in the requirements engineering process a significant overhead. To overcome this problem, we aim at supporting risk management activity in a semi-automated way, merging the capability to exploit existing risk-related information potentially present in a given organisation, with an automated ranking of the goals with respect to the level of risk the decision-maker estimates for them. In particular, this paper proposes an approach to address the general problem of risk decision-making, which combines knowledge about risks assessment techniques and Machine Learning to enable an active intervention of human evaluators in the decision process, learning from their feedback and integrating it with the organisational knowledge. The long term objective is that of improving the capacity of an organisation to be aware and to manage risks, by introducing new techniques in the field of risk management that are able to interactively and continuously extract useful knowledge from the organisation domain and from the decision-maker expertise.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320432,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320432,,2,IEEE Conferences,,P.

Democratic mass participation of users in Requirements Engineering?,,"University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",05-Nov-15,"A large part of Requirements Engineering is concerned with involving system users, capturing their needs, and getting their feedback. As users are becoming more and more demanding, markets and technologies are evolving fast, and systems are getting more and more individual, a broad and systematic user involvement in Requirements Engineering is becoming more important than ever. This paper presents the idea of pushing user involvement in Requirements Engineering to its extreme by systematically delegating the responsibility for developing the requirements and deciding about future releases to the crowd of users. We summarize the pros and cons of this vision, its main challenges, and sketch promising solution concepts, which have been proposed and used in E-Participation and E-Democracy.

Exploiting online human knowledge in Requirements Engineering,,"Division of Computer Science and Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA; Division of Computer Science and Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA",05-Nov-15,"Data-driven Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have noticeably advanced in the past few years. These advances can be tied to the drastic growth of the quality of collaborative knowledge bases (KB) available on the World Wide Web. Such KBs contain vast amounts of up-to-date structured human knowledge and common sense data that can be exploited by NLP methods to discover otherwise-unseen semantic dimensions in text, aiding in tasks related to natural language understanding, classification, and retrieval. Motivated by these observations, we describe our research agenda for exploiting online human knowledge in Requirements Engineering (RE). The underlying assumption is that requirements are a product of the human domain knowledge that is expressed mainly in natural language. In particular, our research is focused on methods that exploit the online encyclopedia Wikipedia as a textual corpus. Wikipedia provides access to a massive number of real-world concepts organized in hierarchical semantic structures. Such knowledge can be analyzed to provide automated support for several exhaustive RE activities including requirements elicitation, understanding, modeling, traceability, and reuse, across multiple application domains.

Improving the social part of a socio-technical system is a meticulous task, as social requirements are diverse and dynamic, and they usually evolve with time and context. Information transparency (henceforth, transparency) is one of the social requirements that can affect the overall attitude of the stakeholders present within a socio-technical system, and influence their other social requirements such as privacy, trust, collaboration and non-bias. In this paper, we advocate the need to engineer transparency as a first class requirement, propose a baseline model for transparency and show how this model can be a starting point for the analysis of transparency requirements of different stakeholders.

Towards a general formal framework of Coherence Management in RE,,"Rutgers University, New Jersey, US; University of Namur, Namur, Belgium; University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel",05-Nov-15,"Coherence Management refers to all efforts one needs to invest, in order to ensure that information shown in, and implied by a representation of requirements makes sense as a whole, is coherent. Coherence Management is an umbrella term we use to cover, and more importantly, stimulate research on relationships between identification, measurement, and action on phenomena which reflect tensions between information in requirements representations. Such tensions exist between information which is, for example, logically inconsistent, or stakeholders disagree on, or signals tradeoffs (meaning that improvement on some requirements, for instance, necessarily means some quantifiable (or not) deterioration of others). These tensions are an important topic of research in Requirements Engineering, and various methods have been proposed for the identification, measurement, and action on logical inconsistency in requirements models, on negotiating disagreements, and on settling tradeoffs. Despite focusing on related phenomena, these methods are different and each come with their own specific definition of when a representation of requirements is incoherent and what to do about it. This makes it hard to compare existing methods, design new ones, and choose those to apply when doing RE. In this short communication we outline our research agenda for developing a unified formal framework for the systematization and classification of Coherence Management efforts in the context of RE, as well as exploring their compatibility.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320436,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320436,Requirements Engineering;Inconsistency Management,,IEEE Conferences,,A.

StakeCloud Tool: From cloud consumers' search queries to new service requirements,,"Department of Informatics University of Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Informatics University of Zurich, Switzerland",05-Nov-15,"Requirements elicitation is indispensable for delivering successful services. Nevertheless, cloud service providers mostly rely on ad-hoc approaches, as there are no dedicated elicitation methods for cloud services. To address this problem, we developed the StakeCloud approach, which helps cloud providers elicit requirements for future cloud services. StakeCloud builds and analyzes fuzzy Galois lattices based on consumers' advanced search queries for cloud services. Our StakeCloud Tool automatically builds the lattice from the given search queries. It provides the requirements analyst with extensive clustering and analysis capabilities as well as means for comparing different newly generated classes of services. These allow identifying the threshold for achieving the largest populations of satisfied consumers with a minimum set of features implemented.

Supporting quantitative assessment of requirements in Goal Orientation,,"Respect-IT S.A., Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; CETIC Research Centre, Charleroi, Belgium",05-Nov-15,"Goal-Orientation provides a rich framework for reasoning about systems during the Requirements Engineering (RE) phase. While critical properties like safety or security can require formal semantics, performing quantitative reasoning on semi-formal models in a much more lightweight approach reveals to be sufficient in many projects.

In order to demonstrate the ability to provide mechanisms that are both generic and powerful, we developed an extension of the Objectiver tool in three directions: (1) internal reasoning capabilities on AND-OR goal/obstacles structures, (2) close integration with an external spreadsheet application and (3) model export for building assessment tools using model-driven engineering techniques. We also demonstrate how our approach can cope with a variety of industrial scenarios requiring some form of quantification such as risk analysis, selection of design alternatives, effort estimation, and assessment of customer satisfaction.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320443,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320443,,1,IEEE Conferences,,R.

Challenges of Requirements Engineering in AUTOSAR ecosystems,,"Software Engineering Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden; Computer Science and Engineering Chalmers, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",05-Nov-15,"AUTOSAR has changed significantly how software is developed in the automotive sector. As a central standard, AUTOSAR enables reuse of software components as well as their interoperability. For AUTOSAR compliant ECU development, car manufacturers source Electronic Control Units (ECUs) from Tier-1 suppliers, but ask those Tier-1 suppliers to install AUTOSAR compliant basic software from a certified AUTOSAR-Tier-2 supplier. In this setup (to which we refer as the AUTOSAR ecosystem), the OEM has a direct business relationship with the Tier-1, but only an indirect relationship to the AUTOSAR-Tier-2 supplier, which leads to complex flows of requirements and related information between the organizations involved. In this extended abstract, we summarize preliminary results of a qualitative investigation of Requirements Engineering challenges in the AUTOSAR ecosystem. In particular, we interviewed 7 project managers from an AUTOSAR-Tier-2 supplier, and triangulated our results with 6 additional interviews with subjects from two Tier-1 suppliers and one OEM. We found that most of the requirements towards the AUTOSAR-Tier-2 supplier can be directly mapped to standard AUTOSAR components. However, a significant amount of requirements were new requirements and specific to the OEM or even a project. The well-known requirements engineering challenges we found to surface in the AUTOSAR ecosystem were mainly connected to these non-standard requirements. Standard and non-standard requirements are usually mixed, which makes it hard to fully leverage the potential benefits of reuse within the AUTOSAR standard. We argue that the holistic ecosystem perspective allows exploration of new strategies for mitigating this challenge.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320445,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320445,,5,IEEE Conferences,,M.

The myth of bad passive voice and weak words an empirical investigation in the automotive industry,,"Research and Development, Daimler AG, Böblingen, Germany; Research and Development, Daimler AG, Ulm, Germany",05-Nov-15,"In requirements engineering literature dealing with natural language specifications, we usually find writing rules like `avoid passive voice' or `do not use weak words'. Adhering to such rules should result in understandable and unambiguous requirements. Passive voice, especially when used without an explicit actor, is considered to result in incomplete requirements. The usage of weak words is considered to result in imprecise requirements that are hardly testable. But is the inversion of the claim correct, i.e. does the violation of the writing rules result in problematic specifications? At least in our environment (the passenger car development of Mercedes-Benz) we observe that authors often use passive voice, and there are many requirements containing weak words. To answer this question, we conducted an empirical investigation whose results we report in this paper. The results of this investigation are quite surprising: The use of passive voice, even when the actor is missing, is almost never problematic, as the missing information (the actor) can in most cases easily derived from the context (i.e. surrounding requirements or the general project context). The usage of weak words may be considered problematic in approximately 12% of all occurrences. For an automatic analysis on weak words linguistic patterns can be defined to detect these problematic occurences.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320451,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320451,Requirements engineering;passive voice;weak words;empirical investiigation,4,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Currently, software development is embedded into a V-Model process that defines how software requirements are extracted from system requirements. In recent years, OEMs have come to recognize the importance and opportunities offered by software, which include better management and shorter time-to-market of distinguishing features. Strategies to better utilize software include in-house software development and new ways to collaborate with suppliers. However, in their effort to take advantage of these opportunities, engineers struggle with the formal process imposed on software development. In this paper, we investigate the impact of this struggle on the flow of requirements, including challenges and practices. We found that new ways of working with requirements had emerged that are partly not supported, partly hindered by the old tooling and processes for requirements engineering. Requirements flow both vertical and horizontal in the organization and across the supply-chain. Support for the new way of working should allow us to refine requirements iteratively throughout their life-cycle, handle the discussion of rationales, and to manage assumptions.

Incorporating preferences from multiple stakeholders in software requirements selection an interactive search-based approach,,"Department of Computer Science, Federal University of Bahia (UFBa), Salvador, Brazil",05-Nov-15,"The software requirements selection process has an important role in software development because it aims in identifying an (close to) optimal subset of candidate requirements by exploiting trade-offs among these requirements to satisfy the demands of users.

How can corpus linguistics help improve requirements writing? Specifications of a space project as a case study,,"CNES, CLLE-ERSS (UMR5263: CNRS & Université Toulouse - Jean Jaurès), Toulouse, France",05-Nov-15,"The specific purpose of this doctoral research is to improve the writing of requirements at the French Space Agency (CNES) by proposing a set of linguistic rules - referred to as a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) - that engineers should follow when writing out specifications in French. CNLs for technical writing do already exist, but if they are reviewed from a linguistic point of view, they are found unsatisfactory and too constraining, because some of the rules they impose lack relevance or are not compatible with the way engineers actually specify large-scale systems. In this research abstract, we will present a methodology based on corpus analysis aimed at improving existing rules and suggesting new ones that are inspired by existing data.

Security Assurance Requirements Engineering (STARE) for trustworthy service level agreements,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K.",05-Nov-15,"With the development of trustworthy services, security requirements are of paramount importance for any service (X-as-a-Service). This work-in-progress paper motivates the need for a new approach to requirements engineering for trustworthy services, which helps organisations to systematically define a set of security requirements and describe these in a service level agreement (SLA). This proposed research aims to provide adequate assurances to users by introducing the concept of the Trustworthy Service Level Agreement (TSLA). The proposed research design involves three stages: The first is to develop an initial method of Security Assurance Requirements Engineering (STARE) by refining the nine Security Quality Requirements Engineering (SQUARE) activities. The key activities of STARE include: eliciting security requirements, classification of security requirements, and developing the novel concept of the TSLA. In the second stage, the effectiveness of STARE is evaluated using two real-world case studies: state cyber defence and lawful interception as a service. Finally, the process of implementing the STARE activities will be evaluated using selected service providers that deliver such services to defence and law enforcement agencies. Given the current state of requirements engineering for services, it is anticipated that this research will have a significant impact in terms of guaranteeing secure and trustworthy services in various domains.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320458,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320458,Requirements engineering for services;requirements elicitation;levels of assurance;trustworthy service level agreement;empirical research,2,IEEE Conferences,,Y.

A magnet-and-spring based visualization technique for enhancing the manipulation of requirements artifacts,,"Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",05-Nov-15,"Requirements engineers model the system of interest from different points of view by creating numerous artifacts. Although they have to deal with a great amount of information, the display space of the devices is limited. This limitation leads to a time consuming navigation through the artifacts. Requirements engineers have to scroll through numerous pages and switch between multiple windows. However, they have to rely on their memory when there is no space left on the screen to view another piece of relevant information. In this research, we propose to develop a novel visualization technique that flexibly creates editable views of a linked set of elements or artifacts where the pieces show different levels of detail according to the user's demand for the current task. Thus, important parts are shown in detail, while the space taken for displaying unimportant parts is minimized. Our conceptual solution is a combination of the focus+context concept and a magnet-and-spring system. The focus+context concept is responsible for resizing and relocating objects to make space for more relevant information. The magnet-and-spring system is responsible for distributing the distortion caused by the focus+context concept throughout the workspace, such that the distorted view of the information looks more natural. Considering the artifacts of a software development project as a single hypothetical artifact enables us to manage the artifacts in the same way we deal with the objects inside an artifact. Our envisaged tool support should be embeddable in requirements applications and bring its benefits to the applications manipulating requirements artifacts.",10.1109/RE.2015.7320459,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320459,requirements engineering;requirements artifacts;focus+context;visualization;navigation;physical metaphor;magnet;spring,,IEEE Conferences,,P.

Now more than ever: Privacy and security are required (keynote),,"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA",29-Sep-14,"Properly protecting information is in all our best interests, but it is a complex undertaking. The fact that regulation is often written by non-technologists, introduces additional challenges and obstacles. Moreover, those who design systems that collect, store, and maintain sensitive information have an obligation to design systems holistically within this broader context of regulatory and legal compliance. There are questions that should be asked when developing new requirements for information systems. For example, how do we build systems to handle data that must be kept secure and private when relevant regulations tie your hands? When building a system that maintains health or financial records for a large number of people, what do we need to do to protect the information against theft and abuse, keep the information private, AND at the same time, satisfy all governing privacy/security laws and restrictions? Moreover, how do we know that we've satisfied those laws? How do we monitor for compliance while ensuring that we're monitoring the right things? And, how do you accomplish all this in a way that can be expressed clearly to end-users and legislators (or auditors) so they can be confident you are doing the right things?

How practitioners approach gameplay requirements? An exploration into the context of massive multiplayer online role-playing games,,"Dept. of Computer Science, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands",29-Sep-14,"Gameplay requirements are central to game development. In the business context of massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMOGs) where game companies' revenues rely on players' monthly subscriptions, gameplay is also recognized as the key to player retention. However, information on what gameplay requirements are and how practitioners `engineer' them in real life is scarce. This exploratory study investigates how practitioners developing MMOGs reason about gameplay requirements and handle them in their projects. 12 practitioners from three leading MMOGs-producing companies were interviewed and their gameplay requirements documents were reviewed. The study's most important findings are that in MMOG projects: (1) gameplay requirements are co-created with players, (2) are perceived and treated by practitioners as sets of choices and consequences, (3) gameplay is endless within a MMOG, and while gameplay requirements do not support any game-end goal, they do support a level-end goal, (4) `paper-prototyping' and play-testing are pivotal to gameplay validation, (5) balancing the elements of the gameplay is an on-going task, perceived as the most difficult and labor-consuming, (6) gameplay happens both in-game and out-of-the game.

Many therapists include commercial motion-based videogames in their therapy sessions to help make rehabilitation exercises fun and engaging. Our initial exploratory work exposed a need for tools to help therapists make evidence-based decisions when choosing commercial motion-games for their patients who have had a BI. Targeting this need, we are gathering requirements for a case-based recommender (CBR) system that will act as a decision tool for therapists. In this paper, we describe our ongoing work as a case study that illustrates our multi-method approach of requirement elicitation for the CBR system. Our approach is comprised of four overlapping steps: (1) interviews with therapists, (2) onsite observations of therapy game sessions, (3) diary studies in which therapists record detailed information about game sessions, and (4) a user study of a CBR prototype interface. Leveraging direct interaction with end users (i.e., therapists), this case study demonstrates requirements gathering techniques to address needs of a special population (i.e., therapists who work with patients who had BIs) in a specialized context (i.e., inpatient rehabilitation using motion-based video games).",10.1109/RE.2014.6912243,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912243,Requirements elicitation;Multi-methods;Brain Injury;Rehabilitation;Therapy;Games;Case-based Recommender,4,IEEE Conferences,,C.

We address this need by describing a novel technique for early decision-making and tradeoff analysis using goal models with uncertainty. The technique analyzes goal satisfaction over sets of models that can result from resolving uncertainty.

Integrating exception handling in goal models,,"ICTEAM – Institute for Information & Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics Université catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; ICTEAM – Institute for Information & Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics Université catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium",29-Sep-14,"Missing requirements are known to be among the major sources of software failure. Incompleteness often results from poor anticipation of what could go wrong with an over-ideal system. Obstacle analysis is a model-based, goal-anchored form of risk analysis aimed at identifying, assessing and resolving exceptional conditions that may obstruct the behavioral goals of the target system. The obstacle resolution step is obviously crucial as it should result in more adequate and more complete requirements. In contrast with obstacle identification and assessment, however, this step has little support beyond a palette of resolution operators encoding tactics for producing isolated countermeasures to single risks. In particular, there is no single clue to date as to where and how such countermeasures should be integrated within a more robust goal model. To address this problem, the paper describes a systematic technique for integrating obstacle resolutions as countermeasure goals into goal models. The technique is shown to guarantee progress towards a complete goal model; it preserves the correctness of refinements in the overall model; and keeps the original, ideal model visible to avoid cluttering the latter with a combinatorial blow-up of exceptional cases. To allow for this, the goal specification language is slightly extended in order to capture exceptions to goals seperately and distinguish normal situations from exceptional ones.

However, no research has determined whether software engineers are able to identify and classify important ambiguities in laws and regulations. Ambiguities in legal texts can make the difference between requirements compliance and non-compliance. Herein, we develop a ambiguity taxonomy based on software engineering, legal, and linguistic understandings of ambiguity. We examine how 17 technologists and policy analysts in a graduate-level course use this taxonomy to identify ambiguity in a legal text. We also examine the types of ambiguities they found and whether they believe those ambiguities should prevent software engineers from implementing software that complies with the legal text. Our research suggests that ambiguity is prevalent in legal texts. In 50 minutes of examination, participants in our case study identified on average 33.47 ambiguities in 104 lines of legal text using our ambiguity taxonomy as a guideline.

Due to a constantly changing environment, long-living software systems “age” not by wearing out, but by failing to keep up-to-date with their environment. The problem is that requirements engineers usually do not have a complete overview of the security-related knowledge necessary to retain security of long-living software systems. This includes security standards, principles and guidelines as well as reported security incidents. In this paper, we focus on the identification of known vulnerabilities (and their variations) in natural-language requirements by leveraging security knowledge. For this purpose, we present an integrative security knowledge model and a heuristic method to detect vulnerabilities in requirements based on reported security incidents. To support knowledge evolution, we further propose a method based on natural language analysis to refine and to adapt security knowledge. Our evaluation indicates that the proposed assessment approach detects vulnerable requirements more reliable than other methods (Bayes, SVM, k-NN). Thus, requirements engineers can react faster and more effectively to a changing environment that has an impact on the desired security level of the information system.",10.1109/RE.2014.6912252,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912252,Security requirements;Heuristics;Requirements analysis;Software evolution;Knowledge carrying software,11,IEEE Conferences,,S.

Moreover, they do not consider the influence of the current behaviour of an executing system on adaptation decisions. In this paper, we propose an improved requirements-driven self-adaptation approach that combines goal reasoning and case-based reasoning. In the approach, past experiences of successful adaptations are retained as adaptation cases, which are described by not only requirements violations and contexts, but also currently deployed behaviours. The approach does not depend on a set of original adaptation cases, but employs goal reasoning to provide adaptation solutions when no similar cases are available. And case-based reasoning is used to provide more precise adaptation decisions that better reflect the complex relations among requirements violations, contexts, and current behaviours by utilizing past experiences. Our experimental study with an online shopping benchmark shows that our approach outperforms both requirements-driven approach and case-based reasoning approach in terms of adaptation effectiveness and overall quality of the system.",10.1109/RE.2014.6912253,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912253,,20,IEEE Conferences,,W.

Organizations often create links in order to meet compliance requirements, but then fail to capitalize on the potential benefits of those links to provide support for activities such as impact analysis, test regression selection, and coverage analysis. One of the major adoption barriers is caused by the lack of accessibility to the underlying trace data and the lack of skills many project stakeholders have for formulating complex trace queries. To address these challenges we introduce TiQi, a natural language approach, which allows users to write or speak trace queries in their own words. TiQi includes a vocabulary and associated grammar learned from analyzing NL queries collected from trace practitioners. It is evaluated against trace queries gathered from trace practitioners for two different project environments.",10.1109/RE.2014.6912254,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912254,Traceability;Queries;Speech Recognition;Natural Language Processing,8,IEEE Conferences,,P.

We make a novel use of requirements traceability to accurately locate where the software should be refactored, and develop a new scheme to precisely determine what refactorings should be applied to the identified places.

Supporting traceability through affinity mining,,"Dipartimento di Informatica, Università di Pisa, Italy; School of Software, University of Technology Sydney, Australia",29-Sep-14,"Traceability among requirements artifacts (and beyond, in certain cases all the way to actual implementation) has long been identified as a critical challenge in industrial practice. Manually establishing and maintaining such traces is a high-skill, labour-intensive job. It is often the case that the ideal person for the job also has other, highly critical tasks to take care of, so offering semi-automated support for the management of traces is an effective way of improving the efficiency of the whole development process. In this paper, we present a technique to exploit the information contained in previously defined traces, in order to facilitate the creation and ongoing maintenance of traces, as the requirements evolve.

How Do Users Like This Feature? A Fine Grained Sentiment Analysis of App Reviews,,"Technische Universität München, Garching, Germany; University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",29-Sep-14,"App stores allow users to submit feedback for downloaded apps in form of star ratings and text reviews. Recent studies analyzed this feedback and found that it includes information useful for app developers, such as user requirements, ideas for improvements, user sentiments about specific features, and descriptions of experiences with these features. However, for many apps, the amount of reviews is too large to be processed manually and their quality varies largely. The star ratings are given to the whole app and developers do not have a mean to analyze the feedback for the single features. In this paper we propose an automated approach that helps developers filter, aggregate, and analyze user reviews. We use natural language processing techniques to identify fine-grained app features in the reviews. We then extract the user sentiments about the identified features and give them a general score across all reviews. Finally, we use topic modeling techniques to group fine-grained features into more meaningful high-level features. We evaluated our approach with 7 apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and compared its results with a manually, peer-conducted analysis of the reviews. On average, our approach has a precision of 0.59 and a recall of 0.51. The extracted features were coherent and relevant to requirements evolution tasks. Our approach can help app developers to systematically analyze user opinions about single features and filter irrelevant reviews.",10.1109/RE.2014.6912257,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912257,,362,IEEE Conferences,,E.

Scaling requirements extraction to the crowd: Experiments with privacy policies,,"Institute for Software Research, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Institute for Software Research, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",29-Sep-14,"Natural language text sources have increasingly been used to develop new methods and tools for extracting and analyzing requirements. To validate these new approaches, researchers rely on a small number of trained experts to perform a labor-intensive manual analysis of the text. The time and resources needed to conduct manual extraction, however, has limited the size of case studies and thus the generalizability of results. To begin to address this issue, we conducted three experiments to evaluate crowdsourcing a manual requirements extraction task to a larger number of untrained workers. In these experiments, we carefully balance worker payment and overall cost, as well as worker training and data quality to study the feasibility of distributing requirements extraction to the crowd. The task consists of extracting descriptions of data collection, sharing and usage requirements from privacy policies. We present results from two pilot studies and a third experiment to justify applying a task decomposition approach to requirements extraction. Our contributions include the task decomposition workflow and three metrics for measuring worker performance. The final evaluation shows a 60% reduction in the cost of manual extraction with a 16% increase in extraction coverage.",10.1109/RE.2014.6912258,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912258,requirements extraction;natural language;crowdsourcing,32,IEEE Conferences,,T.

Discovering affect-laden requirements to achieve system acceptance,,"Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK; Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK; Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK; Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK",29-Sep-14,"Novel envisioned systems face the risk of rejection by their target user community and the requirements engineer must be sensitive to the factors that will determine acceptance or rejection. Conventionally, technology acceptance is determined by perceived usefulness and ease-of-use, but in some domains other factors play an important role. In healthcare systems, particularly, ethical and emotional factors can be crucial. In this paper we describe an approach to requirements discovery that we developed for such systems. We describe how we have applied our approach to a novel system to passively monitor users for signs of cognitive decline consistent with the onset of dementia. A key challenge was eliciting users' reactions to emotionally charged events never before experienced by them at first hand. Our goal was to understand the range of users' emotional responses and their values and motivations, and from these formulate requirements that would maximise the likelihood of acceptance of the system. The problem was heightened by the fact that the key stakeholders were elderly people who represent a poorly studied user constituency.

However, these artifacts may also imply additional security requirements that developers may overlook but should consider to strengthen the overall security of the system. The goal of this research is to aid requirements engineers in producing a more comprehensive and classified set of security requirements by (1) automatically identifying security-relevant sentences in natural language requirements artifacts, and (2) providing context-specific security requirements templates to help translate the security-relevant sentences into functional security requirements. Using machine learning techniques, we have developed a tool-assisted process that takes as input a set of natural language artifacts. Our process automatically identifies security-relevant sentences in the artifacts and classifies them according to the security objectives, either explicitly stated or implied by the sentences. We classified 10,963 sentences in six different documents from healthcare domain and extracted corresponding security objectives. Our manual analysis showed that 46% of the sentences were security-relevant. Of these, 28% explicitly mention security while 72% of the sentences are functional requirements with security implications. Using our tool, we correctly predict and classify 82% of the security objectives for all the sentences (precision). We identify 79% of all security objectives implied by the sentences within the documents (recall).

The challenge is that identifying the most appropriate pattern for a situation can be cumbersome and time-consuming. We propose a new method that combines an inquiry-cycle based approach with the feature diagram notation to review only relevant patterns and quickly select the most appropriate patterns for the situation. Similar to patterns themselves, our approach captures expert knowledge to relate patterns based on decisions made by the pattern user. The resulting pattern hierarchies allow users to be guided through these decisions by questions, which introduce related patterns in order to help the pattern user select the most appropriate patterns for their situation, thus resulting in better requirement generation.

We have argued that incorporating an explicit representation of the environment's topology enables reasoning on the location of assets being protected and the proximity of potentially harmful agents. This paper proposes to engineer topology aware adaptive security systems by identifying violations of security requirements that may be caused by topological changes, and selecting a set of security controls that prevent such violations. Our approach focuses on physical topologies; it maintains at runtime a live representation of the topology which is updated when assets or agents move, or when the structure of the physical space is altered. When the topology changes, we look ahead at a subset of the future system states. These states are reachable when the agents move within the physical space. If security requirements can be violated in future system states, a configuration of security controls is proactively applied to prevent the system from reaching those states. Thus, the system continuously adapts to topological stimuli, while maintaining requirements satisfaction. Security requirements are formally expressed using a propositional temporal logic, encoding spatial properties in Computation Tree Logic (CTL). The Ambient Calculus is used to represent the topology of the operational environment - including location of assets and agents - as well as to identify future system states that are reachable from the current one.

Tackling the requirements jigsaw puzzle,,"School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, UK; School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, UK",29-Sep-14,"A key challenge during stakeholder meetings is that of presenting the requirements and conflicts to stakeholders in a way that fosters co-responsibility and co-ownership regarding the conflicts and their resolution.

The metaphor provides an easy to understand language for stakeholders from otherwise diverse backgrounds. It enables stakeholders to work with a well-understood concept - that of building a system from misshapen pieces. These characteristics foster communication and team work, which improve commitment of stakeholders in co-authoring of requirements and co-responsibility in conflict handling. The gamification of conflict resolution also promotes a relaxed environment, which in turn improves team cooperation and creativity.

Particularly challenging is the definition of good-enough quality. The problem cannot be avoided though, because hitting the right quality level is critical. Too little quality leads to churn for the software product. Excessive quality generates unnecessary cost and drains the resources of the operating platform. To address this problem, we propose to elicit the specific relationships between software quality levels and their impacts for given quality attributes and stakeholders. An understanding of each such relationship can then be used to specify the right level of quality by deciding about acceptable impacts. The quality-impact relationships can be used to design and dimension a software system appropriately and, in a second step, to develop service level agreements that allow re-use of the obtained knowledge of good-enough quality. This paper describes an approach to elicit such quality-impact relationships and to use them for specifying quality requirements.

Improving collaborative and Post-WIMP systems through requirements specification,,"Computer Systems Department, University of Castilla, Albacete, Spain",29-Sep-14,"A proper requirements specification is paramount for achieving the quality of the developed software products. However, well-known Requirements Engineering (RE) techniques lack of enough expressiveness to model the requirements of CSCW systems (Computer Supported Collaborative Work). This is due to the inherent complexity of collaboration among users and their need of awareness. Moreover, the way in which users interact with CSCW systems have evolved greatly to more sophisticated interfaces, beyond the classical desktop computer environments, to those called Post-WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer). Awareness is magnified in such a way that users have to be aware of their context: the artifacts with which to interact, his/her own capabilities as well as those of the others. All this awareness is necessary to allow them to collaborate in virtual and/or augmented environments. This PhD thesis aims at solving this problem by developing a RE framework able to deal with the requirements of CSCW and Post-WIMP systems, making emphasis on the awareness requirements about user's context.",10.1109/RE.2014.6912299,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912299,Requirements;quality;CSCW;Post-WIMP;awareness;CSRML,,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Stakeholders' social interaction in requirements engineering of open source software,,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, USA",29-Sep-14,"Requirements engineering (RE) involves human-centric activities that require interaction among different stakeholders. Traditionally, RE has been considered as a centralized, collocated, and phase-specific process. However, in open-source software (OSS) development environment, the core RE activities are iterative and dynamic and follow a rather decentralized software engineering paradigm. This crosscutting characteristic of open-source RE can be conceptualized using the “Twin Peaks” model that weaves RE together with software architecture. Although many weaving mechanisms have been proposed in recent years, lack of theoretical underpinning limits a mechanism's applicability and usefulness in different scenarios. In this research proposal, we hypothesize stakeholders' social interaction as an ecologically valid weaving mechanism of the “Twin Peaks” in open-source RE. We further outline a concrete research plan to examine the generalizability of this weaving mechanism for three activities: requirements identification, requirements implementation, and creativity in RE. Carrying out this research plan will enable us to gain valuable insights to generate guidelines for enhancing software engineering practice in relevant areas.",10.1109/RE.2014.6912300,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912300,Requirements engineering;twin peaks;opensource RE;requirements identification;requirements implementation;creativity in RE,3,IEEE Conferences,,T.

Aligning services and requirements with user feedback,,"Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology, Sydney",29-Sep-14,"For analysts the alignment between the requirements and the available services presents a significant challenge in service oriented paradigm. To address this challenge various technical solutions have already been proposed. Although technical issues play an important role in this selection but organizational and social factors are equally as important in selecting an optimally aligned service for a specific requirement. The users of services are mostly ignored in the alignment process. User feedback analysis has recently gained a lot of research focus, but these benefits have not been fully explored and utilized in service oriented software development. In this paper I present a method for aligning services to requirements that is designed using the Situational Method Engineering approach and it incorporates user feedback about the services. This feedback assists the analysts in extracting required information for making informed decisions while selecting services among available options that satisfies both the user requirements and customer preferences. The method is supported by a proposed tool. The method and the supporting tool will be validated by a controlled experiment and focus group feedback from the practitioners.",10.1109/RE.2014.6912301,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912301,Users;Requirements;Services;Alignment,4,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Requirements development and management of embedded real-time systems,,"School of Innovation, Mälardalen University, Västerås, Sweden",29-Sep-14,"It is well recognized that most of the anomalies, discovered in the development of embedded real-time systems, belong to requirement and specification phases. To ease the situation, many efforts have been investigated into the area. For requirements development, especially requirements validation and verification, model-driven architecture techniques can be considered as a cost-efficient solution. In order to utilize such advantages, the design of the proposed system is often specified in terms of analyzable models at the certain level of abstraction. Further, different levels of requirements are translated into verifiable queries and fed into the models to be either validated or verified. For requirements management, requirements traceability provides critical support for performing change impact analysis, risk analysis, regression testing, etc. In this thesis, we cover several topics about requirements validation, requirements verification, and requirements traceability. In particular, the technical contributions are three-fold: 1) we propose an approach to requirements validation by using the extended Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language with newly defined TASM constructs and, 2) we present a simulation-based method which is powered up by statistical techniques to conduct requirements verification, working with industrial applications and, 3) we introduce an improved VSM-based requirements traceability recovery approach using a novel context analysis.

In this paper, we perform a large-scale analysis of 2,061 policy documents, including policy documents from the Google Top 1000 most visited websites and the Fortune 500 companies, for three purposes: (1) to assess the readability of these policy documents for requirements engineers; (2) to determine if automated text mining can indicate whether a policy document contains requirements expressed as either privacy protections or vulnerabilities; and (3) to establish the generalizability of prior work in the identification of privacy protections and vulnerabilities from privacy policies to other policy documents.

Formal analysis of privacy requirements specifications for multi-tier applications,,"Institute for Software Research, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA; Institute for Software Research, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA",21-Oct-13,"Companies require data from multiple sources to develop new information systems, such as social networking, e-commerce and location-based services. Systems rely on complex, multi-stakeholder data supply-chains to deliver value. These data supply-chains have complex privacy requirements: privacy policies affecting multiple stakeholders (e.g. user, developer, company, government) regulate the collection, use and sharing of data over multiple jurisdictions (e.g. California, United States, Europe). Increasingly, regulators expect companies to ensure consistency between company privacy policies and company data practices. To address this problem, we propose a methodology to map policy requirements in natural language to a formal representation in Description Logic. Using the formal representation, we reason about conflicting requirements within a single policy and among multiple policies in a data supply chain. Further, we enable tracing data flows within the supply-chain. We derive our methodology from an exploratory case study of Facebook platform policy. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in an evaluation involving Facebook, Zynga and AOL-Advertising policies.

Supporting requirements traceability through refactoring,,"Computer Science and Engineering, Mississippi State University, MS, USA; Computer Science and Engineering, Mississippi State University, MS, USA",21-Oct-13,"Modern traceability tools employ information retrieval (IR) methods to generate candidate traceability links. These methods track textual signs embedded in the system to establish relationships between software artifacts. However, as software systems evolve, new and inconsistent terminology finds its way into the system's taxonomy, thus corrupting its lexical structure and distorting its traceability tracks. In this paper, we argue that the distorted lexical tracks of the system can be systematically re-established through refactoring, a set of behavior-preserving transformations for keeping the system quality under control during evolution. To test this novel hypothesis, we investigate the effect of integrating various types of refactoring on the performance of requirements-to-code automated tracing methods. In particular, we identify the problems of missing, misplaced, and duplicated signs in software artifacts, and then examine to what extent refactorings that restore, move, and remove textual information can overcome these problems respectively. We conduct our experimental analysis using three datasets from different application domains. Results show that restoring textual information in the system has a positive impact on tracing. In contrast, refactorings that remove redundant information impact tracing negatively. Refactorings that move information among the system modules are found to have no significant effect. Our findings address several issues related to code and requirements evolution, as well as refactoring as a mechanism to enhance the practicality of automated tracing tools.",10.1109/RE.2013.6636703,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636703,Refactoring;traceability;information retrieval,14,IEEE Conferences,,A.

This paper lays down the core foundations needed to integrate an expert system into the automated tracing process.

We focus here on requirements verification performed in the early exploratory stages on high-level models and we discuss how this can be integrated into an agile approach. We present a new technique to model-check incomplete high-level specifications against formally specified requirements. We do this in the context of incomplete hierarchical Statecharts, verified against a variation of CTL properties. Our approach supports step-wise specification and refinement verification.

Distributing refinements of a system-level partial behavior model,,"Computer Science Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Computer Science Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA",21-Oct-13,"Early in a system's life cycle, a system's behavior is typically partially specified using scenarios, invariants, and temporal properties. These specifications prohibit or require certain behaviors, while leaving other behaviors uncategorized into either of those. Engineers refine the specification by eliciting more requirements to finally arrive at a complete behavioral description. Partial-behavior models have been utilized as a formal foundation for capturing partial system specifications. Mapping the requirements to partial behavior models enables automated analyses (e.g., requirements consistency checking) and helps to elicit new requirements. Under the current practices, software systems are reasoned about and their behavior specified exclusively at the system level, disregarding of the fact that a system typically consists of interacting components. However, exclusively refining a behavior specification at the system-level runs the risk of arriving at an inconsistent specification, i.e. one that is not realizable as a composition of the system's components. To address this problem, we propose a framework that provides the lacking support: a newly specified requirement implicitly refines the system's underlying partial behavior model; our framework maps the new requirement to components by automatically distributing the system model refinements to the components' underlying models. By doing so, our framework prevents requirements inconsistencies and helps to identify further necessary requirements. We discuss the framework's soundness and correctness, and demonstrate its features on a case study previously used in related literature.",10.1109/RE.2013.6636707,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636707,,3,IEEE Conferences,,I.

Requirements elicitation: Towards the unknown unknowns,,"School of Computing and Communications, University of Lancaster, Lancaster, UK; School of Computing and Communications, University of Lancaster, Lancaster, UK",21-Oct-13,"Requirements elicitation research is reviewed using a framework categorising the relative `knowness' of requirements specification and Common Ground discourse theory. The main contribution of this survey is to review requirements elicitation from the perspective of this framework and propose a road map of research to tackle outstanding elicitation problems involving tacit knowledge. Elicitation techniques (interviews, scenarios, prototypes, etc.) are investigated, followed by representations, models and support tools. The survey results suggest that elicitation techniques appear to be relatively mature, although new areas of creative requirements are emerging. Representations and models are also well established although there is potential for more sophisticated modelling of domain knowledge. While model-checking tools continue to become more elaborate, more growth is apparent in NL tools such as text mining and IR which help to categorize and disambiguate requirements. Social collaboration support is a relatively new area that facilitates categorisation, prioritisation and matching collections of requirements for product line versions. A road map for future requirements elicitation research is proposed investigating the prospects for techniques, models and tools in green-field domains where few solutions exist, contrasted with brown-field domains where collections of requirements and products already exist.

How cloud providers elicit consumer requirements: An exploratory study of nineteen companies,,"Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland",21-Oct-13,"Requirements elicitation is widely seen as a crucial step towards delivering successful software. In the context of emerging cloud systems, the question is whether and how the elicitation process differs from that used for traditional systems, and if the current methods suffice. We interviewed 19 cloud providers to gain an in-depth understanding of the state of practice with regard to the adoption and implementation of existing elicitation methods. The results of this exploratory study show that, whereas a few cloud providers try to implement and adapt traditional methods, the large majority uses ad-hoc approaches for identifying consumer needs. There are various causes for this situation, ranging from consumer reachability issues and previous failed attempts, to a complete lack of development strategy. The study suggests that only a small number of the current techniques can be applied successfully in cloud systems, hence showing a need to research new ways of supporting cloud providers. The main contribution of this work lies in revealing what elicitation methods are used by cloud providers and clarifying the challenges related to requirements elicitation posed by the cloud paradigm.

Visual notation design 2.0: Towards user comprehensible requirements engineering notations,,"University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; PReCISE Research Centre, Namur, Belgium; PReCISE Research Centre, Namur, Belgium; Ozemantics Private Limited, Sydney, Australia",21-Oct-13,"The success of requirements engineering depends critically on effective communication between business analysts and end users, yet empirical studies show that business stakeholders understand RE notations very poorly. This paper proposes a novel approach to designing RE visual notations that actively involves naïve users in the process. We use i*, one of the most influential RE notations, to demonstrate the approach, but the same approach could be applied to any RE notation. We present the results of 5 related empirical studies that show that novices outperform experts in designing symbols that are comprehensible to novices: the differences are both statistically significant and practically meaningful. Symbols designed by novices increased semantic transparency (their ability to be spontaneously interpreted by other novices) by almost 300% compared to the existing i* notation. The results challenge the conventional wisdom about visual notation design: that it should be conducted by a small group of experts; our research suggests that it should instead be conducted by large numbers of novices. The approach is consistent with Web 2.0, in that it harnesses the collective intelligence of end users and actively involves them in the notation design process as “prosumers” rather than passive consumers. We believe this approach has the potential to radically change the way visual notations are designed in the future.",10.1109/RE.2013.6636711,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636711,Visual languages;empirical research;modelling;analysis;end user communication;requirements analysis,57,IEEE Conferences,,P.

User feedback in the appstore: An empirical study,,"Technische Universität München, Munich, Germany; University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",21-Oct-13,"Application distribution platforms - or app stores - such as Google Play or Apple AppStore allow users to submit feedback in form of ratings and reviews to downloaded applications. In the last few years, these platforms have become very popular to both application developers and users. However, their real potential for and impact on requirements engineering processes are not yet well understood. This paper reports on an exploratory study, which analyzes over one million reviews from the Apple AppStore. We investigated how and when users provide feedback, inspected the feedback content, and analyzed its impact on the user community. We found that most of the feedback is provided shortly after new releases, with a quickly decreasing frequency over time. Reviews typically contain multiple topics, such as user experience, bug reports, and feature requests. The quality and constructiveness vary widely, from helpful advices and innovative ideas to insulting offenses. Feedback content has an impact on download numbers: positive messages usually lead to better ratings and vice versa. Negative feedback such as shortcomings is typically destructive and misses context details and user experience.

The challenge lies in the difficulty of analyzing and assessing the proneness to requirement changes across multiple versions, especially when the scale of requirements is large. In this paper, we define a series of metrics to characterize historic evolution information, and propose a novel method for predicting requirements that are likely to evolve in the future based on the metrics. We apply the prediction method to analyze the product updates history through a case study. The empirical results show that this method can provide a tradeoff solution that narrows down the scope of change analysis to a small set of requirements, but it still can retrieve nearly half of the future changes. The results indicate that the defined metrics are sensitive to the history of requirements evolution, and the prediction method can reach a valuable outcome for requirement engineers to balance their workload and risks.",10.1109/RE.2013.6636713,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636713,Requirements evolution;prediction model;volatility measure;case study,10,IEEE Conferences,,L.

Assessing regulatory change through legal requirements coverage modeling,,"Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Institute for Software Research, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",21-Oct-13,"Developing global markets offer companies new opportunities to manufacture and sell information technology (IT) products in ways unforeseen by current laws and regulations. This innovation leads to changing requirements due to changes in product features, laws, or the locality where the product is sold or manufactured. To help developers rationalize these changes, we introduce a preliminary framework and method that can be used by requirements engineers and their legal teams to identify relevant legal requirements and trace changes in requirements coverage. The framework includes a method to translate IT regulations into a legal requirements coverage model used to make coverage assertions about existing or planned IT systems. We evaluated the framework in a case study using three IT laws: California's Confidentiality of Medical Records Act, the U.S. Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and amendments from the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, and the India 2011 Information Technology Rules.

A goal model elaboration for localizing changes in software evolution,,"University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan; University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan; National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan",21-Oct-13,"Software evolution is an essential activity that adapts existing software to changes in requirements. Localizing the impact of changes is one of the most efficient strategies for successful evolution. We exploit requirements descriptions in order to extract loosely coupled components and localize changes for evolution. We define a process of elaboration for the goal model that extracts a set of control loops from the requirements descriptions as components that constitute extensible systems. We regard control loops to be independent components that prevent the impact of a change from spreading outside them. To support the elaboration, we introduce two patterns: one to extract control loops from the goal model and another to detect possible conflicts between control loops. We experimentally evaluated our approach in two types of software development and the results demonstrate that our elaboration technique helps us to analyze the impact of changes in the source code and prevent the complexity of the code from increasing.",10.1109/RE.2013.6636715,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636715,Software evolution;goal modeling;elaboration techniques;control loops,9,IEEE Conferences,,H.

As in all composite applications, the component services are composed and configured to meet requirements for the composite application. However, in a field experiment of composite service-oriented applications wef found that, although the services as actually delivered by the service providers meet their requirements, there is still a mismatch across service providers due to unstated assumptions, and that this mismatch causes an incorrect composite application to be delivered to end-users. Identifying and analyzing these initially unstated assumptions turns requirements engineering for service-oriented applications into risk analysis. In this paper, we describe a field experiment with an experimental service-oriented homecare system, in which unexpected behavior of the system turned up unstated assumptions about the contributing service providers. We then present an assumptions-driven risk identification method that can help identifying these risks, and we show how we applied this method in the second iteration of the field experiment. The method adapts some techniques from problem frame diagrams to identify relevant assumptions on service providers. The method is informal, and takes the “view from nowhere” in that it does not result in a specification of the component services, but for every component service delivers a set of assumptions that the service must satisfy in order to contribute to the overall system requirements.

We empirically investigated how requirements dependencies correlate with and predict software integration bugs, which can provide early estimate regarding software quality, therefore facilitate decision making early in the software lifecycle. We conducted network analysis on requirements dependency networks of two commercial software projects. We then performed correlation analysis between network measures (e.g., degree, closeness) and number of bugs. Afterwards, bug prediction models were built using these network measures. Significant correlation is observed between most of our network measures and number of bugs. These network measures can predict the number of bugs with high accuracy and sensitivity. We further identified the significant predictors for bug prediction. Besides, the indication effect of network measures on bug number varies among different types of requirements dependency.

Researchers argue that effective traceability barely happens by chance or through ad-hoc efforts and that traceability should be explicitly defined upfront. However, in a previous study we found that practitioners rarely follow explicit traceability strategies. We were interested in the reason for this discrepancy. Are practitioners able to reach effective traceability without an explicit definition? More specifically, how suitable is requirements traceability that is not strategically planned in supporting a project's development process. Our interview study involved practitioners from 17 companies. These practitioners were familiar with the development process, the existing traceability and the goals of the project they reported about. For each project, we first modeled a traceability strategy based on the gathered information. Second, we examined and modeled the applied software engineering processes of each project. Thereby, we focused on executed tasks, involved actors, and pursued goals. Finally, we analyzed the quality and suitability of a project's traceability strategy. We report common problems across the analyzed traceability strategies and their possible causes. The overall quality and mismatch of analyzed traceability suggests that an upfront-defined traceability strategy is indeed required.

Requirements reviews revisited: Residual challenges and open research questions,,"Munich, Germany",21-Oct-13,"It is widely accepted that early reviews on requirements specifications (RS) are an effective and efficient quality assurance technique. So why are they still not applied all over the software industry? In this paper we pinpoint that this is due to five major challenges: 1) Software requirements are based on flawed `upstream' requirements and reviews on RS are thus in vain. 2) The impact of sociological issues related to reviews is underestimated. 3) Important quality aspects of RS escape reviews. 4) The goal of applying reviews is not made clear and different review approaches are mixed. 5) Incremental software development poses specific challenges to applying reviews on RS. In this paper we argue that in order to solve these five challenges research on reviews must take a more holistic approach, stretching to pre-project phases and incorporating various other disciplines in order to add more value for the software industry.

Preventing premature design in the requirements permits the available design space not to be restricted too early which might inhibit innovative designs. In practice, on many industrial projects, separating the problem and solution domain entities can be difficult, and arguably there are benefits for not doing so. Many customers feel more confident describing their requirements, often as the difference between the existing products and their needs, some customers have such intimate knowledge of their products that their requirements tend to be very specific, and if the customer knows the exact solution needed thatnaturally will reduce the cost of the requirements elicitation as well as design activities. Practitioners are challenged to understand when having solution information in requirements is sensible and when it should be avoided.

Why feature dependencies challenge the requirements engineering of automotive systems: An empirical study,,"Institut für Informatik, Technische Universität München, Garching, Germany; BMW Group, Dimensioning Functions Driving Dynamics and Driver Assistance, München, Germany",21-Oct-13,"Functional dependencies and feature interactions in automotive software systems are a major source of erroneous and deficient behavior. To overcome these problems, many approaches exist that focus on modeling these functional dependencies in early stages of system design. However, there are only few empirical studies that report on the extent of such dependencies in industrial software systems and how they are considered in an industrial development context. In this paper, we analyze the functional architecture of a real automotive software system with the aim to assess the extent, awareness and importance of interactions between features of a future vehicle. Our results show that within the functional architecture at least 85% of the analyzed vehicle features depend on each other. They furthermore show that the developers are not aware of a large number of these dependencies when they are modeled solely on an architectural level. Therefore, the developers mention the need for a more precise specification of feature interactions, e.g., for the execution of comprehensive impact analyses.

This paper presents an elicitation method for new telemedicine applications in a collaborative setting of time-constraint medical practitioners and requirements engineers if the medical researcher is absent. Engineers compensate this lack of resources through cross-disciplinary studies and use of pathophysiological models in the absence of medical evidence.

The impact of requirements on software quality across three product generations,,"Intel Corporation, USA",21-Oct-13,"In a previous case study, we presented data demonstrating the impact that a well-written and well-reviewed set of requirements had on software defects and other quality indicators between two generations of an Intel product.

Quality indicators for the second software product all improved dramatically even with the increased complexity of the newer product. This paper will recap that study and then present data from a subsequent Intel case study revealing that quality enhancements continued on the third generation of the product. The third generation software was designed and coded using the final set of requirements from the second version as a starting point. Key product differentiators included changes to operate with a new Intel processor, the introduction of new hardware platforms and the addition of approximately fifty new features. Software development methodologies were nearly identical, with only the change to a continuous build process for source code check-in added.

In order to systematically inspect a SRS, we developed a perspective-based inspection methodology based on PQM (Pragmatic Quality Model) of SRS. PQM is derived from IEEE Std. 830 from the perspective of pragmatic quality. To inspect a SRS according to PQM, we identified 198 inspection points, which lead to a quality score between 0 and 100. The requirements clinic advises to the requirements engineering team by a comprehensive quality inspection report including quality score, benchmark and SRS patterns for improvement. Since 2010, we have been practicing the methodology to a variety of development projects, and revealed an average of 10.6 ROI in 12 projects. We also discuss the feasibility of the methodology and lessons learned from the practices.",10.1109/RE.2013.6636732,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636732,Requirements verification and validation;Third party inspection;Quality model of requirements specifications,9,IEEE Conferences,,S.

The glossary terms are identified in two steps - a) compute units (which are candidates for glossary terms) b) disambiguate between the mutually exclusive units to identify terms. We introduce novel linguistic techniques to identify process nouns, abstract nouns and auxiliary verbs. The identification of units also handles co-ordinating conjunctions and adjectival modifiers. This requires solving co-ordination ambiguity and adjectival modifier ambiguity. The identification of terms among the units adapts an in-document statistical metric.

Studies reveal that 30-40% of software defects can be traced to gaps or errors in requirements Although several models and techniques have been defined to optimize the requirements process, ensuring alignment and consistency of elicited requirements continues to be a challenge. All software engineering standards and methodologies recognize the importance of maintaining relationships among the software elements for traceability. We have leveraged the structured relationships among the requirement elements to come up with an approach to systematically carry out consistency analysis of requirements for software systems. The framework has multiple models: a multi layered requirement model, a configuration structure to link and track the requirement items, a consistency analysis method to identify the inconsistencies in the requirements and a consistency index computation to indicate the level of consistency in overall requirements of the software system. This approach helps to validate the requirements from both completeness and correctness perspectives and also check their consistency in forward and backward directions.

The regulatory world and the machine: Harmonizing legal requirements and the systems they affect,,"Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",21-Oct-13,"The past decade has seen a substantial increase in the issuance of privacy and security regulations governing personal information. Ensuring system and organizational compliance is both more important and more difficult than ever before, as the penalties have become more severe, and regulations more complex and nuanced. This also presents substantial difficulties for multi-national companies, as different states, countries, or regions do not adhere to a uniform standard, resulting in a mixed set of regulations for the systems they govern. In this work, I describe a framework to address this issue, referred to as requirements water marking, wherein requirements from different jurisdictions that govern the same system may be evaluated and reduced to a single standard of care, establishing a “high water mark” for regulatory compliance and reducing requirements complexity. The framework, which draws on work in requirements specification languages and requirements comparison, allows engineers and legal experts to systematically simplify compliance and determine both high and low standards of care, while maintaining traceability back to the original legal text. In addition, I investigate the proposed value of legal requirements models, demonstrating the relationship between proposed value of these models to organizational decision-making and the validity of the model.",10.1109/RE.2013.6636760,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636760,,2,IEEE Conferences,,D.

Evidence management for evolutionary safety assurance and certification,,"Department of Software Engineering, Simula Research Laboratory, Norway",21-Oct-13,"Safety assurance and certification are amongst the most expensive and time-consuming activities in the development of safety-critical systems. Deeming a system to be safe involves gathering convincing evidence to argue the safe operation of the system, usually according to the requirements of some safety standard. To handle large collections of safety evidence effectively, practitioners need knowledge of how to classify different types of evidence, how to structure the evidence to show fulfilment of standards' requirements, and how to assess the evidence. However, the notion of evidence is vague and safety standards' requirements can be ambiguous and difficult to understand. Major problems also arise when a system evolves, as the body of safety evidence has to be adequately maintained in order to ensure system safety and allow its demonstration. In this context, this PhD aims to propose a framework for safety evidence management in evolutionary scenarios. The thesis work will concentrate on devising a model-based and customizable infrastructure for storage, manipulation, reuse, and analysis of evolving safety evidence. The infrastructure will be developed and evaluated in the scope of OPENCOSS a large-scale European research project.",10.1109/RE.2013.6636761,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636761,Safety-critical system;safety standards;safety compliance;safety certification;safety evidence;evidence evolution;evidence traceability;change impact,,IEEE Conferences,,S.

Managing requirements uncertainty with partial models,,"University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada",10-Nov-12,"Models are good at expressing information that is known but do not typically have support for representing what information a modeler does not know at a particular phase in the software development process.

Due to the intrinsic vagueness of speculative language, speculative requirements risk being misunderstood, and related uncertainty overlooked, and may benefit from careful treatment in the requirements engineering process. In this paper, we present a linguistically-oriented approach to automatic detection of uncertainty in natural language (NL) requirements. Our approach comprises two stages. First we identify speculative sentences by applying a machine learning algorithm called Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to identify uncertainty cues. The algorithm exploits a rich set of lexical and syntactic features extracted from requirements sentences. Second, we try to determine the scope of uncertainty. We use a rule-based approach that draws on a set of hand-crafted linguistic heuristics to determine the uncertainty scope with the help of dependency structures present in the sentence parse tree.

Identifying outdated requirements based on source code changes,,"Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Switzerland",10-Nov-12,"Keeping requirements specifications up-to-date when systems evolve is a manual and expensive task. Software engineers have to go through the whole requirements document and look for the requirements that are affected by a change. Consequently, engineers usually apply changes to the implementation directly and leave requirements unchanged. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically detecting outdated requirements based on changes in the code. Our approach first identifies the changes in the code that are likely to affect requirements. Then it extracts a set of keywords describing the changes. These keywords are traced to the requirements specification, using an existing automated traceability tool, to identify affected requirements. Automatically identifying outdated requirements reduces the effort and time needed for the maintenance of requirements specifications significantly and thus helps preserve the knowledge contained in them. We evaluated our approach in a case study where we analyzed two consecutive source code versions and were able to detect 12 requirements-related changes out of 14 with a precision of 79%. Then we traced a set of keywords we extracted from these changes to the requirements specification.

Companies are subject to new regulations from one or more governing bodies, when companies introduce new or existing products into a jurisdiction, when regulations change, or when data is transferred across political borders.

The agency then considers these comments when drafting a final rule that will be binding on the regulated domain.

Identifying and evaluating assets are therefore key activities in any security engineering process - from modeling threats and attacks, discovering existing vulnerabilities, to selecting appropriate countermeasures. However, despite their crucial role, assets are often neglected during the development of secure software systems. Indeed, many systems are designed with fixed security boundaries and assumptions, without the possibility to adapt when assets change unexpectedly, new threats arise, or undiscovered vulnerabilities are revealed. To handle such changes, systems must be capable of dynamically enabling different security countermeasures. This paper promotes assets as first-class entities in engineering secure software systems. An asset model is related to requirements, expressed through a goal model, and the objectives of an attacker, expressed through a threat model. These models are then used as input to build a causal network to analyze system security in different situations, and to enable, when necessary, a set of countermeasures to mitigate security threats. The causal network is conceived as a runtime entity that tracks relevant changes that may arise at runtime, and enables a new set of countermeasures.

By their very nature, such systems operate under uncertainty as components fail, humans act in unpredictable ways, and the environment of the system changes. Self-repair refers to the ability of such systems to restore fulfillment of their requirements by relying on monitoring, reasoning, and diagnosing on the current state of individual requirements. Self-repair is complicated by the multi-agent nature of socio-technical systems, which demands that requirements monitoring and self-repair be done in a decentralized fashion. In this paper, we propose a stateful requirements monitoring approach by maintaining an instance of a state machine for each requirement, represented as a goal, with runtime monitoring and compensation capabilities. By managing the interactions between the state machines, our approach supports hierarchical goal reasoning in both upward and downward directions.

Privacy arguments: Analysing selective disclosure requirements for mobile applications,,"Open University, UK; Open University, UK; Open University, UK; Open University, UK; Frogfish Technologies, UK; Lero, Ireland; Open University, UK",10-Nov-12,"Privacy requirements for mobile applications offer a distinct set of challenges for requirements engineering. First, they are highly dynamic, changing over time and locations, and across the different roles of agents involved and the kinds of information that may be disclosed. Second, although some general privacy requirements can be elicited a priori, users often refine them at runtime as they interact with the system and its environment. Selectively disclosing information to appropriate agents is therefore a key privacy management challenge, requiring carefully formulated privacy requirements amenable to systematic reasoning. In this paper, we introduce privacy arguments as a means of analysing privacy requirements in general and selective disclosure requirements (that are both content- and context-sensitive) in particular. Privacy arguments allow individual users to express personal preferences, which are then used to reason about privacy for each user under different contexts. At runtime, these arguments provide a way to reason about requirements satisfaction and diagnosis.

A feature model consists of a feature tree and cross-tree constraints. Identifying features and then building a feature tree takes a lot of effort, and many semi-automated approaches have been proposed to help the situation. However, finding cross-tree constraints is often more challenging which still lacks the help of automation. In this paper, we propose an approach to mining cross-tree binary constraints in the construction of feature models. Binary constraints are the most basic kind of cross-tree constraints that involve exactly two features and can be further classified into two sub-types, i.e. requires and excludes. Given these two sub-types, a pair of any two features in a feature model falls into one of the following classes: no constraints between them, a requires between them, or an excludes between them. Therefore we perform a 3-class classification on feature pairs to mine binary constraints from features. We incorporate a support vector machine as the classifier and utilize a genetic algorithm to optimize it. We conduct a series of experiments on two feature models constructed by third parties, to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach under different conditions that might occur in practical use. Results show that we can mine binary constraints at a high recall (near 100% in most cases), which is important because finding a missing constraint is very costly in real, often large, feature models.",10.1109/RE.2012.6345798,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345798,feature model;binary constraints;support vector machine,10,IEEE Conferences,,L.

Moreover, very often not only a single product, but a whole product line with different compositions of components and functions must be developed. To cope with this complexity, it is important that engineers have intuitive, but precise means for specifying the requirements for these systems and have tools for automatically finding inconsistencies within the requirements, because these could lead to costly iterations in the later development. We propose a technique for the scenario-based specification of component interactions based on Modal Sequence Diagrams. Moreover, we developed an efficient technique for automatically finding inconsistencies in the scenario-based specification of many variants at once by exploiting recent advances in the model-checking of product lines.

What you need is what you get!: The vision of view-based requirements specifications,,"Fraunhofer IESE, Kaiserslautern, Germany; Fraunhofer IESE, Kaiserslautern, Germany",10-Nov-12,"Software requirements specifications play a crucial role in software development projects. Especially in large projects, these specifications serve as a source of communication and information for a variety of roles involved in downstream activities like architecture, design, and testing.

In this paper, the authors introduce the idea of view-based requirements specifications. Two scenarios illustrate (1) current problems and challenges related to the research underlying the envisioned idea and (2) how these problems could be solved in the future.

The impact of domain knowledge on the effectiveness of requirements idea generation during requirements elicitation,,"Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada; Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada",10-Nov-12,"It is believed that the effectiveness of requirements engineering activities depends at least partially on the individuals involved. One of the factors that seems to influence an individual's effectiveness in requirements engineering activities is knowledge of the problem being solved, i.e., domain knowledge. While a requirements engineer's having in-depth domain knowledge helps him or her to understand the problem easier, he or she can fall for tacit assumptions of the domain and might overlook issues that are obvious to domain experts. This paper describes a controlled experiment to test the hypothesis that adding to a requirements elicitation team for a computer-based system in a particular domain, requirements analysts that are ignorant of the domain improves the effectiveness of the requirements elicitation team. The results, although not conclusive, show some support for accepting the hypothesis.

Using collective intelligence to detect pragmatic ambiguities,,"ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy; ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy",10-Nov-12,"This paper presents a novel approach for pragmatic ambiguity detection in natural language (NL) requirements specifications defined for a specific application domain. Starting from a requirements specification, we use a Web-search engine to retrieve a set of documents focused on the same domain of the specification. From these domain-related documents, we extract different knowledge graphs, which are employed to analyse each requirement sentence looking for potential ambiguities. To this end, an algorithm has been developed that takes the concepts expressed in the sentence and searches for corresponding “concept paths” within each graph. The paths resulting from the traversal of each graph are compared and, if their overall similarity score is lower than a given threshold, the requirements specification sentence is considered ambiguous from the pragmatic point of view. A proof of concept is given throughout the paper to illustrate the soundness of the proposed strategy.",10.1109/RE.2012.6345803,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345803,requirements/specifications analysis;natural language;ambiguity detection;pragmatic ambiguity,31,IEEE Conferences,,A.

A probabilistic framework for goal-oriented risk analysis,,"Département dIngénierie Informatique, Université catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; Département dIngénierie Informatique, Université catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium",10-Nov-12,"Requirements completeness is among the most critical and difficult software engineering challenges. Missing requirements often result from poor risk analysis at requirements engineering time. Obstacle analysis is a goal-oriented form of risk analysis aimed at anticipating exceptional conditions in which the software should behave adequately. In the identify-assess-control cycles of such analysis, the assessment step is not well supported by current techniques. This step is concerned with evaluating how likely the obstacles to goals are and how likely and severe their consequences are. Those key factors drive the selection of most appropriate countermeasures to be integrated in the system goal model for increased completeness. Moreover, obstacles to probabilistic goals are currently not supported; such goals prescribe that some corresponding target property should be satisfied in at least X% of the cases. The paper presents a probabilistic framework for goal specification and obstacle assessment. The specification language for goals and obstacles is extended with a probabilistic layer where probabilities have a precise semantics grounded on system-specific phenomena. The probability of a root obstacle to a goal is thereby computed by up-propagation of probabilities of finer-grained obstacles through the obstacle refinement tree. The probability and severity of obstacle consequences is in turn computed by up-propagation from the obstructed leaf goals through the goal refinement graph. The paper shows how the computed information can be used to prioritize obstacles for countermeasure selection towards a more complete and robust goal model. The framework is evaluated on a non-trivial carpooling support system.",10.1109/RE.2012.6345805,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345805,obstacle analysis;risk assessment;probabilistic goals;requirements completeness;goal-oriented requirements engineering;risk analysis;quantitative reasoning,16,IEEE Conferences,,A.

Through measuring contribution degrees of low-level decisions to the fulfilment of high-level quality goals and combining them with priority statements, it is possible to compare alternative solutions of the requirements problem against each other. But where do contribution measures come from and what is the right way to combine them in order to do such analysis? In this paper we describe how full application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be used to quantitatively assess contribution relationships in goal models based on stakeholder input and how we can reason about the result in order to make informed decisions. An exploratory experiment shows that the proposed procedure is feasible and offers evidence that the resulting goal model is useful for guiding a decision.

Concern-Driven Development (CDD) enables requirements engineers to encapsulate and reason about concerns, whether they are crosscutting (i.e., aspects) or not. However, to truly capitalize on the benefits promised by CDD, concerns need to be encapsulated across software development phases, i.e., across different types of models at different levels of abstraction. Recently, URN was extended to support aspect-oriented concepts. This demonstration focuses on the new concern-driven modeling features of jUCMNav, together with its capabilities to compose aspects together, and to transform aspectual scenario models into design models in the Reusable Aspect Models notation. jUCMNav is hence one of the few tools that enable CDD from requirements to design.",10.1109/RE.2012.6345823,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345823,aspects;concerns;jUCMNav;Reusable Aspect Models;User Requirements Notation;Use Case Maps,,IEEE Conferences,,D.

Business requirements analysis and development for legacy system replacement projects in government organizations,,"Department of Computing, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK",10-Nov-12,"E-Government innovation is commonly hindered by legacy systems in public sector agencies.

The problem is not easy to identify and qualify, unless a critical stance to requirements analysis is taken, and unless requirements are examined in the context of processes that are creative, exploratory and collaborative.

A Pattern-based approach for analysing requirements in socio-technical systems engineering,,"Research Center for Information System Design, Kassel University, Kassel, Germany",10-Nov-12,"Requirements analysis for socio-technical systems faces the challenge of multidisciplinary requirements that need to be collected from, understood by and agreed upon by various stakeholders. In some cases, requirements analysts or involved stakeholders do not fully understand the requirements that other disciplines impose, and thus fail to deliver a requirements specification that can be used in interdisciplinary development teams. In requirements engineering, requirement patterns are used to recognize important and recurring issues, thus reducing the effort of compiling a list of software requirements. The objective of the proposed dissertation project is to develop a similar pattern based approach that helps in analysing requirements from different disciplines and making them comprehensible for all stakeholders who need to agree to a requirement specification as the deliverable of requirements engineering. Due to the importance of legal aspects for, and users' trust in, socio-technical systems, requirement patterns will be developed for these two aspects. For the legal requirement patterns, legal requirements that are stable concerning changes due to their origin in fundamental, higher-ranked laws will be collected, and requirement patterns will be derived from them. For the requirement patterns for trust support, antecedents that build trust will be collected, and requirement patterns that demand functionality to support these antecedents will be developed. The obtained patterns are then used to compile a requirement list that serves as input for requirements negotiation with the various stakeholders.",10.1109/RE.2012.6345834,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345834,socio-technical systems;software requirement pattern;trust;law,2,IEEE Conferences,,A.

On the usage of context for requirements elicitation: End-user involvement in IT ecosystems,,"SEGAL, Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada",10-Nov-12,"Today's systems are faced with the need of constant evolution to remain competitive, especially when looking at IT Ecosystems and their growing number of subsystems. As a prerequisite for these to stay competitive, system providers need a clear understanding of their stakeholder's needs. As systems tend to be increasingly complex nowadays, support an increasingly number of stakeholders, have a shorter release cycles to evolve and need to adapt to the environment and the users, some of the standard requirements elicitation techniques tend not to be suitable any more. Especially when adaptivity is necessary, system providers need to understand the context, in which the systems are used, but also the context of users for the adaptation. In this paper I concentrate on the largest stakeholder group, namely the end-users for requirements elicitation. Evaluation criteria include (i) support of context, (ii) scalability to large numbers of end-users, and (iii) scalability to large numbers of end-user's needs and problems that lead to new requirements. My literature review suggests that this important field is currently underrepresented in Requirements Engineering research. This research proposes to develop a framework that explains the different context types and their role for requirements elicitation. The framework is then used to investigate existing requirements elicitation techniques and their potential for considering context. It is also used to show how emerging techniques can further support requirements elicitation with context.",10.1109/RE.2012.6345835,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345835,end-user involvement;requirements elicitation;social media;observation,6,IEEE Conferences,,A.

Model-based prioritization in business-process-driven software development,,"Fraunhofer IESE, Kaiserslautern, Germany",10-Nov-12,"Requirements engineers in business-process-driven software development are faced with the challenge of letting stakeholders determine which requirements are actually relevant for early business success and should be considered first or even at all during the elicitation and analysis activities. In the area of requirements engineering (RE) and release planning, prioritization is an established strategy for achieving this goal. Available prioritization approaches, however, do not consider all idiosyncrasies of business-process-driven software development. This lack of appropriate prioritization leads to effort often being spent on (RE) activities of minor importance. To support the requirements engineer in overcoming this problem, the idea of applying different models during prioritization is introduced, which shall bring it to a more reliable basis. Through this notion it is expected to reduce unnecessary (RE) activities by focusing on the most important requirements.",10.1109/RE.2012.6345836,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345836,Requirements Engineering;Requirements Prioritization;Requirements Elicitation;Business-Process-Driven Requirements Engineering;Information Systems,8,IEEE Conferences,,N.

StakeCloud: Stakeholder requirements communication and resource identification in the cloud,,"Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",10-Nov-12,"With the recent emergence of cloud computing, the number of cloud service providers is constantly increasing and consumers' needs are becoming more sophisticated. This situation leads to an evident need for methods which enable providers to correctly elicit requirements coming from very heterogeneous consumers. Moreover, consumers demand ways to find the cloud services which best meet their needs. We propose to address the issues identified by creating the StakeCloud community platform, capable of working as a cloud resources marketplace. It will allow users to input their resource needs and provide them with matching cloud services. Additionally, in case these are not met, they can be communicated as new requirements to cloud providers.

At this early stage of development, only overall goals of features are understood, and there is a need to discover all possible scenarios of operation. We have developed a formalism - Structured Transition Systems (STS) - that facilitates the rapid evolution of specifications. STS supports multiple idioms of specification : transitions, state-diagrams, scenarios etc. It also supports constructs for hierarchical organization of a specification. We have further defined analyses that are useful for review and inspection of STS specifications. A distinctive feature of our method is the ability to use analysis results to refine and reinforce parts of the specification by importing analysis results into STS specifications. In practice, this leads to a feedback loop where requirements can be rapidly refined using analysis engines to drive the development of requirements.

In particular, while most research on design for software focuses on finding some correct solution, this ignores that such a solution is often only correct in a particular, and often short-lived, context. Using a logic-based goal-oriented requirements modeling language, the paper poses the problem of finding desirable solutions as the requirements change. Among other possible criteria of desirability, we consider minimizing the effort required to implement the new solution, which involves reusing parts of the old solution. In general, the solution of requirements problems is viewed as an exploration using a “requirements engineering knowledge base” (REKB), whose specification is formalized. The paper reports on experience implementing the REKB on top of a so-called “reason-maintenance system”, and provides evidence that incremental solution finding is indeed more efficient.",10.1109/RE.2011.6051656,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051656,Requirements;evolution;incremental;knowledge-level,26,IEEE Conferences,,N.

Software requirements change taxonomy: Evaluation by case study,,"School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queens University, Belfast, UK; School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queens University, Belfast, UK",20-Oct-11,"Although a number of requirements change classifications have been proposed in the literature, there is no empirical assessment of their practical value in terms of their capacity to inform change monitoring and management. This paper describes an investigation of the informative efficacy of a taxonomy of requirements change sources which distinguishes between changes arising from `market', `organisation', `project vision', `specification' and `solution'. This investigation was effected through a case study where change data was recorded over a 16 month period covering the development lifecycle of a government sector software application. While insufficiency of data precluded an investigation of changes arising due to the change source of `market', for the remainder of the change sources, results indicate a significant difference in cost, value to the customer and management considerations. Findings show that higher cost and value changes arose more often from `organisation' and `vision' sources; these changes also generally involved the co-operation of more stakeholder groups and were considered to be less controllable than changes arising from the `specification' or `solution' sources.

Based on an assumption of what causes gaps in communication of requirements and what effects such gaps have, a semi-structured interview study was performed with nine practitioners at a large market-driven software company. We found four main factors that affect the requirements communication, namely scale, temporal aspects, common views and decision structures. The results also show that communication gaps lead to failure to meet the customers' expectations, quality issues and wasted effort. An increased awareness of these factors is a help in identifying what to address to achieve a more efficient requirements management, and ultimately more efficient and successful software development.

Through on-site observations, interviews with the developers and application of social network analysis, we found that there was significant communication between diverse roles in the project, and identified what were the reasons for communication between the different roles. We also found that these interactions typically involved a core of requirements analysts and testers in close communication, that most often they involved critical members whose absence, whether temporary or permanent, would disrupt the information flow if removed from the project, as well as that new hires were mostly isolated from the team collaboration.

Facilitated workshops with cross-functional teams were used to analyze the customers' processes in their entirety and to create a holistic view to roadmapping.

We found that ad-hoc prioritization and priority grouping of requirements are the dominant methods for prioritizing quality requirements. The results also show that it is common to use customer input as criteria for prioritization but absence of any criteria was also common. The results suggests that quality requirements by default have a lower priority than functional requirements, and that they only get attention in the prioritizing process if decision-makers are dedicated to invest specific time and resources on QR prioritization.

Simulating and optimising design decisions in quantitative goal models,,"Department of Computer Science, University College London, UK; Department of Computer Science, University College London, UK",20-Oct-11,Making decisions among a set of alternative system designs is an essential activity of requirements engineering. It involves evaluating how well each alternative satisfies the stakeholders' goals and selecting one alternative that achieves some optimal tradeoffs between possibly conflicting goals. Quantitative goal models support such activities by describing how alternative system designs - expressed as alternative goal refinements and responsibility assignments - impact on the levels of goal satisfaction specified in terms of measurable objective functions. Analyzing large numbers of alternative designs in such models is an expensive activity for which no dedicated tool support is currently available. This paper takes a first step towards providing such support by presenting automated techniques for (i) simulating quantitative goal models so as to estimate the levels of goal satisfaction contributed by alternative system designs and (ii) optimising the system design by applying a multi-objective optimisation algorithm to search through the design space. These techniques are presented and validated using a quantitative goal model for a well-known ambulance service system.,10.1109/RE.2011.6051653,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051653,requirements simulation and optimisation;quality requirements;goal-oriented requirements engineering;quantitative modelling;search-based software engineering,39,IEEE Conferences,,W.

Understanding clusters of optimal solutions in multi-objective decision problems,,"Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, UK; Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, UK",20-Oct-11,"Multi-objective decisions problems are ubiquitous in requirements engineering. A common approach to solve them is to apply search-based techniques to generate a set of non-dominated solutions, formally known as the Pareto front, that characterizes all solutions for which no other solution performs better on all objectives simultaneously. Analysing the shape of the Pareto front helps decision makers understand the solution space and possible tradeoffs among the conflicting objectives. Interpreting the optimal solutions, however, remains a significant challenge. It is in particular difficult to identify whether solutions that have similar levels of goals attainment correspond to minor variants within a same design or to very different designs involving completely different sets of decisions. Our goal is to help decision makers identify groups of strongly related solutions in a Pareto front so that they can understand more easily the range of design choices, identify areas where strongly different solutions achieve similar levels of objectives, and decide first between major groups of solutions before deciding for a particular variant within the chosen group. The benefits of the approach are illustrated on a small example and validated on a larger independently-produced example representative of industrial problems.",10.1109/RE.2011.6051654,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051654,Cost-value based requirements selection;multi-objective decision making;hierarchical clustering;search-based software engineering,19,IEEE Conferences,,V.

Logical structure extraction from software requirements documents,,"Generative Software Development Laboratory, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada; Generative Software Development Laboratory, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada; Generative Software Development Laboratory, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada",20-Oct-11,"Software requirements documents (SRDs) are often authored in general-purpose rich-text editors, such as MS Word. SRDs contain instances of logical structures, such as use case, business rule, and functional requirement. Automated recognition and extraction of these instances enables advanced requirements management features, such as automated traceability, template conformance checking, guided editing, and interoperability with requirements management tools such as RequisitePro. The variability in content and physical representation of these instances poses challenges to their accurate recognition and extraction. To address these challenges, we present a framework allowing 1) the specification of logical structures in terms of their content, textual rendering, and variability and 2) the extraction of instances of such structures from rich-text documents. Our evaluation involves 36 different logical structures identified in 43 SRDs and shows that the intended content, style, and variability of these structures can be specified in the framework such that their instances can be extracted from the documents with high precision and recall, both close to 100%.",10.1109/RE.2011.6051638,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051638,Logical Structures;SRS;Requirements Extraction;Software Requirements Documents,9,IEEE Conferences,,R.

In this context, several challenges need to be overcome: theoretical, technical, methodological and community-related. In this paper, we review current i*-based frameworks under several possible scenarios and observe that not all of these challenges are always addressed, and even more, there is lack of guidelines or well-accepted methodological design steps on how to overcome these issues. Then, we detail the several engineering artifacts and techniques whose consideration in i*-based frameworks may help to overcome them.

A context analysis method for embedded systems — Exploring a requirement boundary between a system and its context,,"Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan; University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",20-Oct-11,"Many embedded systems not only affect their context through actuators but also are affected by the context through sensors. It is important to provide a context-dependent development method for constructing safe and reliable embedded systems. However, most of the current requirements analysis methods do not explicitly provide a systematic way for deciding the boundary of the context that should be taken into account because it is essentially difficult to decide which context element should be included as the targets of requirements analysis. If a developer explores the context boundary in an ad-hoc manner, he or she will be faced with the frame problem because there are unlimited context elements in the real world where the target system exists. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a context-dependent requirements analysis method called CAMEmb (Context Analysis Method for Embedded systems) in which only the value-context elements are extracted as the associated context elements. Applying the guide words provided by CAMEmb, we can explore only a sequence of context elements directly or indirectly affecting the data value observed or controlled by the system sensors and actuators. Other context elements not affecting the system observation and control are not taken into account because these context elements do not affect the system behavior. Using CAMEmb and lightweight formal tools, we can explore the context boundary that guarantees the expected system behavior. We developed CAMEmbModeler, a support tool consisting of a CAMEmb-based modeling editor and a model compiler that transforms system and context models into the design model reflecting the context boundary.",10.1109/RE.2011.6051648,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051648,context analysis;frame problem;embedded systems;formal verification,5,IEEE Conferences,,N.

Focusing spontaneous feedback to support system evolution,,"Software Engineering Department, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany",20-Oct-11,"Modern software systems are rarely built from scratch. They rather evolve over a long period of time while components and subsystems are developed independently. During that evolution, new and changing requirements emerge when end-users interact with the system. Users encounter situations that provoke spontaneous complaints or suggestions, which may be the seed of new requirements. However, there are two challenges: How to capture spontaneous reactions and how to focus and let them mature into valid requirements? We propose concepts that enable citizens to report a problem or make a suggestion by Smartphone. A key for preserving the spontaneous impetus is to lower the threshold for composing and sending feedback. Software providers who are interested in feedback can define filtering and focusing aids; they guide end-users in giving focused feedback. Focused feedback is also better prepared to be transformed to requirements. Our ConTexter tool demonstrates technical feasibility of these concepts. We explore and characterize a potential application domain empirically. Based on the findings, we discuss potentials and limitations of our approach.",10.1109/RE.2011.6051645,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051645,Spontaneous feedback;system evolution;matchmaking;Smartphone,24,IEEE Conferences,,K.

Structured and unobtrusive observation of anonymous users and their context for requirements elicitation,,"Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany; Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hannover, Germany",20-Oct-11,"Today, people find themselves surrounded by IT systems in their everyday life. Often they are not even aware that they are interacting with an IT system. More and more of these systems are context adaptive. Requirements to such systems may change for various reasons: The context may fundamentally change when other systems are introduced. New trends and fashions may evolve. Operators need to react quickly to such changes if they want to keep their systems competitive. Traditional approaches to requirements elicitation start to fail in this situation: context adaptive systems serve many users with different profiles. In addition, users may be reluctant to participate in improving it. Thus, it is hard to establish a representative model of requirements. Furthermore, it is hard to capture the context of requirements by subsequent interviews. In this paper we present a systematical approach for requirements elicitation based on observing anonymous users. The interaction of users with the system is observed in the normal working context. Observation is based on assumptions on how interaction should take place. Deviations from these assumptions point to new requirements. Observing a large number of users leads to a quantitative map of requirements in context. Preliminary evaluation shows that the approach is promising. It allows efficient observation of many stakeholders and the derivation of new requirements.",10.1109/RE.2011.6051660,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051660,requirements evolution;user observation;requirements elicitation;context adaptive systems,17,IEEE Conferences,,O.

Requirements engineers need guidance as to how to address cross-references in order to comply with the requirements of the law.

Assessing the accuracy of legal implementation readiness decisions,,"North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA; North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA; North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA; North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA",20-Oct-11,"Software engineers regularly build systems that are required to comply with laws and regulations. To this end, software engineers must determine which requirements have met or exceeded their legal obligations and which requirements have not. Requirements that have met or exceeded their legal obligations are legally implementation ready, whereas requirements that have not met or exceeded their legal obligations need further refinement. Research is needed to better understand how to support software engineers in making these determinations. In this paper, we describe a case study in which we asked graduate-level software engineering students to assess whether a set of software requirements for an electronic health record system met or exceeded their corresponding legal obligations as expressed in regulations created pursuant to the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We compare the assessment made by graduate students with an assessment made by HIPAA compliance subject matter experts. Additionally, we contrast these results with those generated by a legal requirements triage algorithm.

Early failure prediction in feature request management systems,,"Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, UK; Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, UK; Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, UK",20-Oct-11,"Online feature request management systems are popular tools for gathering stakeholder requirements during system evolution. Deciding which feature requests require attention and how much upfront analysis to perform on them is an important problem in this context: too little upfront analysis may result in inadequate functionalities being developed, costly changes, and wasted development effort; too much upfront analysis is a waste of time and resources. Early predictions about which feature requests are most likely to fail due to insufficient or inadequate upfront analysis could facilitate such decisions. Our objective is to study whether it is possible to make such predictions automatically from the characteristics of the online discussions on feature requests. The paper presents a tool-implemented framework that automatically constructs failure prediction models using machine-learning classification algorithms and compares the performance of the different techniques for the Firefox and Netbeans projects. The comparison relies on a cost-benefit model for assessing the value of additional upfront analysis. In this model, the value of additional upfront analysis depends on its probability of success in preventing failures and on the relative cost of the failures it prevents compared to its own cost. We show that for reasonable estimations of these two parameters automated prediction models provide more value than a set of baselines for some failure types and projects.

Requirements negotiation for multilayer system components,,"Centro de Certificación de Calidad del Software, Universidad Del Pacífico, Cuenca, Ecuador; Software Engineering for Information Systems Group (GESSI), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain",20-Oct-11,"Current software systems are hybrid in nature.

In such systems, components are usually arranged into layers (e.g., hardware platform, operating systems and database layers, among others) to allow for their operation and interaction. Although several methods have been proposed to support OTS component selection, the truth is that in many cases the process is driven by political and other non-technical aspects, considering components as independent and isolated. Because of this, relevant stakeholder's requirements and concerns, as well as the implications that the selection of a particular component may bring to the system architecture, are simply ignored. In the worst case this may lead to the selection of unsuited or inappropriate components and eventually to miscarried projects, but more often to situations in which projects froze due to lack of stakeholders' agreement in relation to the newly created architectural scenario and some of its emerging requirements. In this paper we address these issues and present a proposal that uses software quality models as framework to support the negotiation of both initial and emerging requirements and the reconciliation of stakeholders' concerns. The approach considers components at different layers of system's architecture. The advantages of the proposal are illustrated with a real case conducted in a banking organization.",10.1109/RE.2011.6051632,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051632,Requirements negotiation;hybrid systems;layered architecture;off-the-shelf component;COTS;quality model,1,IEEE Conferences,,J.

What are the day-to-day factors that are preventing business analysts from effective business analysis?,,"Software Education, Sydney, NSW, Australia; School of Informatics, City University London, UK",20-Oct-11,"This industrial experience paper reports the results of a survey of business analysts to understand the barriers that they perceive are inhibiting effective requirements work in business-oriented projects. The survey was designed to investigate a mismatch between requirements education, training and practice that, we conjecture, was inhibiting effective requirements work by business analysts. Results revealed that, in spite of the education and training undertaken by many business analysts, their involvement in requirement projects appears to be often ad hoc and ineffective. This paper reports factors that business analysts cited as preventing them from applying their requirements analysis knowledge in practice and becoming effective professionals engaged in business analysis and associated systems engineering activities.

"There's never enough time: Doing requirements under resource constraints, and what requirements engineering can learn from agile development",,"Phonak AG, Stafa, Switzerland",20-Oct-11,"While Requirements Engineering textbooks state that a requirements specification must be complete, in real-life projects we are always starting too late, with too few resources, so we can't do everything. The software development community has solved a similar problem (not having enough resources to implement everything that was asked for) by introducing agile development methods, which offer ways of segmenting the overall project, and choosing which parts to allocate resources to. This paper is about how insights from that agile development community can be applied to requirements engineering activities for any (agile or non-agile) development project. Key terms in agile development, such as “working product” and “user story”, must be mapped intelligently to terms in requirements engineering - and not simply copied: the “product” of requirements engineering is not the same as the “product” being implemented by developers.",10.1109/RE.2011.6051626,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051626,requirements engineering;triage;agile development;systems projects,7,IEEE Conferences,,B.

How to assign cost to “avoidable requirements creep”: A step towards the waterfall's agilization,,"Dell GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany; Fahney Anforderungsingenieurwesen GmbH, Zurich, Switzerland",20-Oct-11,"Scope creep is a major risk in fixed price projects. It has been suggested to distinguish between so-called “avoidable creep” and “unavoidable creep” where “avoidable creep” results from stopping requirements engineering (RE) effort too early e.g. for cost-saving reasons. However, no suggestion has been made how to assign cost to “avoidable creep” to quantify the consequence of too early stopped RE effort and to get that type of creep managed or even considerably reduced. From our experience in real and large fixed price projects, we derived a suggestion for solving this problem as soon as possible. The suggested solution has not yet been tried out in practice. However, with this paper we would like to begin a discussion about the suggested solution, and whether it could solve the problem of valuating “avoidable creep”, could thereby reduce both the customer's and the supplier's risk in large fixed price projects and, as a side-effect, serves as a step in converging pure waterfall and pure agile procedures.",10.1109/RE.2011.6051623,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051623,change request;fixed price contract;requirements management;requirements change;release management,5,IEEE Conferences,,S.

Semi-automatic identification of features in requirement specifications,,"Group Research and Advanced Engineering, Daimler AG, Ulm, Germany; Group Research and Advanced Engineering, Daimler AG, Ulm, Germany",20-Oct-11,Reuse of requirements leads to reduction in time spent for specification of new products. Variant management of requirement documents is an essential prerequisite in terms of a successful reuse of requirements. It supports the decisions if available requirements can be reused or not. One possibility to document the variability is feature modelling. One main challenge while introducing feature modelling in a grown environment is to extract product features from large natural language specifications. The current practice is a manual review of specifications conducted by domain experts. This procedure is very costly in terms of time. A promising approach to optimize feature identification is a semi-automatic identification of features in natural language specifications based on lexical analysis. This paper presents the current approaches used for handling variability in automotive specifications at Daimler passenger car development along with first experiences gained in using the optimized approach for feature identification using a lexical analysis.,10.1109/RE.2011.6051627,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051627,feature identification;specifications;automotive;variability management;requirements management,9,IEEE Conferences,,E.

A Method for Identifying Software Requirements Based on Policy Commitments,,"Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA; Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA",15-Nov-10,"Online policy documents-such as privacy policies, notices of privacy practices, and terms of use-describe organizations' information practices for collecting, storing, and using consumers' personal information. Organizations need to ensure that the commitments they express in their policy documents reflect their actual business practices. This compliance is significant in the United States where the Federal Trade Commission regulates fair business practices. Therefore, the requirements engineers developing systems for organizations need to understand the policy documents in order to know the information practices with which the software must comply. The requirements engineers also must ensure that the commitments expressed in these policy documents are incorporated into the software requirements. In this paper, we present a summative case study of a commitment analysis approach. The approach was developed during a formative case study of four healthcare organizations' policy documents. Within this approach, we obtain requirements from policy documents based on our theory of commitments, privileges, and rights. During our summative case study we applied our commitment analysis approach to eight healthcare organizations' policy documents in order to validate the methodology.

We have concluded that the product-related design problems that once were manageable with rational thinking have gradually evolved into problems that have multiple and conflicting interpretations, different value orientations, unclear goals, contradictions and paradoxes. These problems occur due to the demands imposed by larger and much more diverse sets of critical stakeholders drawn from the new global business environment with its multi-cultural needs and greater numbers of highly domain-skilled, computer naïve users.

Requirements-Aware Systems: A Research Agenda for RE for Self-adaptive Systems,,"Computing Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK; Computing Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK; Computing Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK; Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, UK; Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, UK",15-Nov-10,"Requirements are sensitive to the context in which the system-to-be must operate. Where such context is well understood and is static or evolves slowly, existing RE techniques can be made to work well. Increasingly, however, development projects are being challenged to build systems to operate in contexts that are volatile over short periods in ways that are imperfectly understood. Such systems need to be able to adapt to new environmental contexts dynamically, but the contextual uncertainty that demands this self-adaptive ability makes it hard to formulate, validate and manage their requirements. Different contexts may demand different requirements trade-offs. Unanticipated contexts may even lead to entirely new requirements. To help counter this uncertainty, we argue that requirements for self-adaptive systems should be run-time entities that can be reasoned over in order to understand the extent to which they are being satisfied and to support adaptation decisions that can take advantage of the systems' self-adaptive machinery. We take our inspiration from the fact that explicit, abstract representations of software architectures used to be considered design-time-only entities but computational reflection showed that architectural concerns could be represented at run-time too, helping systems to dynamically reconfigure themselves according to changing context. We propose to use analogous mechanisms to achieve requirements reflection.

By linking the overall satisfaction to a business value indicator as feedback, we propose a control theoretic self-tuning method that can dynamically adjust the tradeoff decisions among different quality requirements.

SLAs for availability and response time are common practice in business, but so far there is no practical method for specifying confidentiality requirements in an SLA.

Several modeling languages were proposed so far to specify PL. Although they can be very different, these languages show two common features: they emphasize (a) variability, and (b) the specification of constraints to define acceptable configurations. It is now widely acknowledged that configuring a product can be considered as a constraint satisfaction problem. It is thus natural to consider constraint programming as a first choice candidate to specify constraints on PL. For instance, the different constraints that can be specified using the FODA language can easily be expressed using boolean constraints, which enables automated calculation and configuration using a SAT solver. But constraint programming proposes other domains than the boolean domain: for instance integers, real, or sets. The integer domain was, for instance, proposed by Benavides to specify constraints on feature attributes. This paper proposes to further explore the use of integer constraint programming to specify PL constraints. The approach was implemented in a prototype tool.

Persuading Software Development Teams to Document Inspections: Success Factors and Challenges in Practice,,"F-Secure Corporation, Helsinki, FINLAND; Aalto University, Espoo, FINLAND; previously employed by F-Secure Corporation, Finland; previously employed by F-Secure Corporation, Finland; Aalto University, Espoo, FINLAND",15-Nov-10,"Peer reviews have been identified as one of the best practices in requirements engineering. The most formal peer review technique - inspection - has been found to be effective for the discovery of defects in documents. Nonetheless, many software companies practice inspections infrequently or not at all. For instance, some engineers consider inspections to be uncreative work that adds costs. This paper describes the success factors and challenges involved in persuading review teams to document inspections. The case study utilized an action research approach over a 10-year period, during which two separate attempts were made to address inspection practices. Document inspections did not gain a sustainable position in the study. Consequently, key success factors and challenges were identified in order to explain how the review teams changed their perception throughout the adoption of document inspection. Long-term engagement to document inspection requires motivation and commitment on the part of the teams, and the favorable development culture of an organization, dedicated champions, and the careful tailoring of inspection practices seem to positively influence this. In the long run, it can be challenging to keep document inspections consistent with the existing values, previous experiences, and needs of the software development teams.",10.1109/RE.2010.40,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636543,Software Inspection;Requirements Specification;Action Research;Quality Control;Human Factors,5,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Transition to Agile Development - Rediscovery of Important Requirements Engineering Practices,,"Nokia Research Center, Nokia Corporation, Helsinki, Finland; Nokia Devices, Nokia Corporation, Espoo, Finland; Nokia Devices, Nokia Corporation, Espoo, Finland",15-Nov-10,"Many organizations have started to use agile development processes to speed up the development cycle and to improve the ability of the company in reacting to changing requirements. Adopting agile practices may happen as a revolution where all old practices are removed or as a more gradual process. In this paper, we discuss lessons learnt in two agile transition processes. Based on our experience, agile processes can be used in embedded software development for products. The challenges include the varying size of user requirements, the role of system requirements, and architecturally significant requirements. It is difficult for large organizations to be agile. Work allocation for a large number of different teams with different competencies tends to decrease speed, and increase the role of design and management. We conclude that agile development in this context needs very skilled developers and has to be a combination of new and old practices.",10.1109/RE.2010.41,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636644,agility;requirements engineering;best practices,37,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Enhancing Customer Partnership Through Requirements Framework,,"IGate Global Solutions, Organization Excellence group, Bangalore, India; IGate Global Solutions, Organization Excellence group, Bangalore, India",15-Nov-10,"iGATE, the first integrated Technology & Operations (iTOPS) organization in India had a steady climb in the customer's value chain in terms of penetrating deeper (instead of wider) into customer portfolio. More and more customers were proposing `partnership' model. One of the focus areas in partnership was `requirements engineering' as the challenges faced in this area were affecting both iGATE and its customers. In spite of iGATE having established process and tools, some of the critical projects experienced cost and schedule overruns due to missed requirements. While the conventional Root Cause Analysis (RCA) approach resulted in incremental benefits, an integrated approach to tackle the challenge was the need of the hour. The paper portrays how a robust Requirements Framework was evolved over a period of one and half years crossing several milestones on its journey such as integration of training and technology, project execution and facilitation. The results of implementation was (i) increase in completely owned development projects from 2% to 12%, (ii) increase in resources engaged in requirements phase of project from 8% to 24% and (iii) improved annual organization level customer satisfaction results. Growing by its strength, the organization at present is not only leveraging the requirements framework for successful execution of projects within iGATE.

Model Based Requirements Analysis and Testing of Automotive Systems with Timed Usage Models,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany; Department of Computer Science, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany; Department of Computer Science, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany",15-Nov-10,"In the automotive industry requirements are often still composed of natural language text, spreadsheets, drawings, and formal models. Models are often used to describe partial aspects from the whole set of requirements. Hence, flaws and vagueness in requirements are common and hard to discover. Upcoming standards like ISO 26262 request the automotive industry to be more strict and formal on the requirements. Formal notation and unambiguitiy is explicitely stated. In the field of system and acceptance testing requirements are the basis for all activities. Although, requirements are often not close to testing. To overcome this we introduced the Timed Usage Model (TUM) as a formal representation of requirements specification. During the creation of the model the requirements are analyzed and brought into an unambiguous and formal representation. Traceability is achieved, as each path in the model must be based upon a requirement. The formulation of the requirements in form of an unambiguous model clarifies the requirements and helps to detect design errors. During the creation of the model omissions and flaws in the requirements are discovered. The model serves as a communication medium when functionality responsibles are involved to clarify these aspects. Timed Usage Models were created for power train functionality and the energy management.

Feature Unweaving: Refactoring Software Requirements Specifications into Software Product Lines,,"University of Switzerland, Switzerland; Universitat Zurich, Zurich, ZH, CH; University of Switzerland, Switzerland; University of Switzerland, Switzerland",15-Nov-10,"The design of the variability of a software product line is crucial to its success and evolution. Meaningful variable features need to be elicited, analyzed, documented and validated when an existing software or reference system evolves into a software product line. These variable features are the main discriminators between individual products and they need to reflect the needs of a large variety of stakeholders adequately. In this paper we present a novel approach, called feature unweaving, that supports the identification and extraction of variable features from a given graphical software requirements model. We have extended our aspect-oriented software product line modeling tool such that it supports feature unweaving: it takes a set of model elements that a domain requirements engineer considers to constitute a variable feature and automatically refactors the model into a semantically equivalent one in which the model elements belonging to this feature are grouped into an aspect. This allows the identification and modeling of variable features in an incremental style. It also substantially reduces both the intellectual and clerical effort required for constructing the variable parts of a software product line requirements model.",10.1109/RE.2010.59,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636578,,5,IEEE Conferences,,R.

Practical Challenges for Methods Transforming i* Goal Models into Business Process Models,,"Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Ghent University, Belgium; Department of Applied Economic Sciences, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium; Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Ghent University, Belgium",17-Nov-09,"The field of requirements engineering for business processes has grown during the last several years. As business processes are assumed to fulfil organizational goals, goal models could be transformed into business process models that specify how business processes fulfil the organizational goals. Although both the fields of Goal-Oriented RE (GORE) and Business Process Management (BPM) received a lot of attention from researchers, the methods to transform goal models into business process models still need further research. This scientific evaluation paper analyses current methods to identify the practical challenges that need to be addressed for an effective transformation of goal models into business process models. We illustrate the discovered challenges using the case study of Seven-Eleven Japan. The main challenges that were discovered are a lack of responsible role, insufficient concept mappings, informality of the transformation algorithm, no full support for organisational structure and a lack of inter-model consistency checks. Our expected contribution of discovering these challenges is to lower the barriers of transferring new goal-to-process methods to industry.

In particular, a production rule model facilitates communication between requirements engineers and legal domain experts, supports and augments requirements elicitation, and resolves ambiguity. Prior work in this area has failed to detail a precise methodology for translating a legal text into production rules, and considered using production rule models for aiding requirements elicitation and validation.

In order to reach that goal, real-world business processes are captured by business process models. These models serve as the basis for the declarative configuration of a SOA using appropriate deployment artifacts - i.e., XML-based process languages. Consequently, requirements engineering for SOAs must focus on business processes and on their integration into systems using interoperable services, which is not the case for most conventional requirements engineering approaches. In this paper we present a requirements engineering approach specifically designed for the engineering of SOAs. Requirements are captured using a unified process, based on phases and iterations eventually leading to a formalized and unambiguous requirements specification. The final requirements specification can be used in succeeding development phases - i.e. for the model-driven generation of deployment artifacts for SOAs.

Semantic-Based Interaction Detection in Aspect-Oriented Scenarios,,"SITE, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada; Department of Computing, InfoLab21, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK; SITE, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada",17-Nov-09,"Interactions between dependent or conflicting aspects are a well-known problem with aspect-oriented development (and related paradigms). These interactions are potentially dangerous and can lead to unexpected or incorrect results when aspects are composed. To date, most aspect interaction detection methods have been based either on purely syntactic comparisons or have relied on heavyweight formal methods. We present a new approach that is based instead on lightweight semantic annotations of aspects. Each aspect is annotated with domain-specific markers and a separate influence model describes how semantic markers from different domains influence each other. Automated analysis can then be used both to highlight semantic aspect conflicts and to trade-off aspects. We apply this technique to early aspects, namely, aspect scenarios, because it is desirable to detect aspect interactions as early in the software lifecycle as possible. We evaluate the technique using an industrial case study and show that the technique detects interactions that cannot be discovered using syntactic techniques.",10.1109/RE.2009.13,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5328559,Aspect Interactions;Feature Interactions;Aspect-oriented Modeling;Goal Modeling;Semantic Interactions,7,IEEE Conferences,,G.

Finding Defects in Natural Language Confidentiality Requirements,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada; Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada",17-Nov-09,"Large-scale software systems must adhere to complex, multi-lateral security and privacy requirements from regulations.

This paper presents an alternative approach to analyzing requirements by using semantic annotations placed directly into the original NL documents. The benefits of this alternative approach are twofold: (1) it can effectively be supported by an interactive annotation tool and (2) there is a direct traceability between annotation structures and the original NL documents.

Trust Trade-off Analysis for Security Requirements Engineering,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Canada; Faculty of Information, University of Toronto, Canada",17-Nov-09,"Security requirements often have implicit assumptions about trust relationships among actors. The more actors trust each other, the less stringent the security requirements are likely to be. Trust always involves the risk of mistrust; hence, trust implies a trade-off: gaining some benefits from depending on a second party in trade for getting exposed to security and privacy risks. When trust assumptions are implicit, these trust trade-offs are made implicitly and in an ad-hoc way. By taking advantage of agent- and goal-oriented analysis, we propose a method for discovering trade-offs that trust relationships bring. This method aims to help the analyst select among alternative dependency relationships by making explicit trust trade-offs.

On the Use of Requirements for Driving Call-for-Tender Processes for Procuring Coarse-grained OTS Components,,"Universidad del Azuay, Ecuador; Universitat Poliltècnica de Catalunya, Catalonia, Spain",17-Nov-09,"Because of their complexity, software systems are currently built by integrating components of different nature into hybrid architectures, usually including some third party Off-The-Shelf (OTS) components. Several methods have been proposed to support OTS component selection. Most of them work by comparing requirements, incrementally gained though several iterations, and component descriptions. However, the iterative nature of these methods makes them practically unsuitable in some cases, particularly when conducting call-for-tender-based processes for selecting coarse-grained OTS components. In these cases, company goals need to be thoughtfully and systematically engineered to obtain a well structured set of requirements, which is to remain static during the entire procurement process and cannot be validated through hands-on experimentation. In this paper we report a case study in the selection of an ERP system for a telecommunications company using a call-for-tender process.

For a verification engineer, they offer an opportunity to better participate in requirements changes. Changes in requirements can be more easily propagated because adapting formalized scenarios is often easier than deriving and updating a large set of test cases. The proposed idea is evaluated in a case study encompassing over 50 functional requirements of an automotive software developed at Robert Bosch GmbH.

Requirements engineering techniques are faced with a recurring problem of focus and structure. Elicitation techniques raise the problem of focussing and structuring elicitation sessions and artefacts. Evaluation techniques raise the problem of identifying and comparing items at a common level of abstraction and granularity for risk analysis, conflict management, option selection, or prioritization. Specification techniques offer mechanisms for structuring specifications but do not tell us much on how a complex structure should be built through such mechanisms. For quality assurance, inspection techniques are more effective if inspections can be focussed on structured specifications. Validation and verification techniques require the availability of structured specifications as well. Likewise, evolution techniques are more effective when a rich structure is available for defining change units, granularities of traceable items, built-in derivation links, and satisfaction arguments to be replayed in case of change.",10.1109/RE.2009.50,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5328496,,1,IEEE Conferences,,A. van Lamsweerde,,,,,,,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5328496,,,,,,,,

Learning to Write Better Requirements through Heuristic Critiques,,"Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany; Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany; Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany",17-Nov-09,"Writing good requirements is difficult. Authors of requirements specifications need to acquire specific habits and professional writing styles to avoid ambigu-ities. However, gaining and sharing related experience and abilities is challenging. Heuristic Critiques offer help in this situation. Experience on writing good re-quirements can be codified as heuristic critiques. When integrated in a requirements tool, a heuristic critique can automatically check requirements specifications and provide constructive feedback (critique), whenever a piece of experience is applicable. Observing this feedback helps requirements authors to transfer expe-rience in writing, and internalize it. In this paper we describe the concept of learning to write better re-quirements through heuristic critiques - both, on an individual level and on an organizational level.

This paper focuses solely on the problem of maintaining a set of traceability relations in the face of evolutionary change, irrespective of whether generated manually or via automated techniques, and it limits its scope to UML-driven development activities post-requirements specification. The paper proposes an approach for the automated update of existing traceability relations after changes have been made to UML analysis and design models. The update is based upon predefined rules that recognize elementary change events as constituent steps of broader development activities.

Examining the Relationships between Performance Requirements and “Not a Problem” Defect Reports,,"Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, USA; Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, USA; ABB, Inc.",21-Nov-08,"Missing or imprecise requirements can lead stakeholders to make incorrect assumptions. A ""not a problem"" defect report (NaP) describes a software behavior that a stakeholder regards as a problem while the developer believes this behavior is acceptable and chooses not to take any action. As a result, a NaP wastes the time of the development team because resources are spent analyzing the problem but the quality of the software is not improved. Performance requirements specification and analysis are instance-based. System performance can change based upon the execution environment or usage patterns. To understand how the availability and precision of performance requirements can affect NaP occurrence rate, we conducted a case study on an embedded control module. We applied the performance refinement and evolution model to examine the relationship between each factor in the performance requirements and the corresponding NaP occurrence rate. Our findings show that precise specification of subjects or workloads lowers the occurrence rate of NaPs. Precise specification of measures or environments does not lower the occurrence rate of NaPs. Finally, the availability of performance requirements does not affect NaP occurrence rate in this case study.",10.1109/RE.2008.51,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685662,requirements engineering;software performance requirements,7,IEEE Conferences,,C. -W.

The validated FRPs are then amenable to semantic case analysis so as to uncover the variation structures. Finally, merging FRPs helps discover the requirements interdependencies. We use orthogonal variability modeling to represent the product line's external variability and constraints. We apply our approach to an auto-marker product line.

A Formal Approach to Semantic Composition of Aspect-Oriented Requirements,,"Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK; Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK; Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK",21-Nov-08,"The goal of aspect-oriented requirements engineering (AORE) is to identify possible crosscutting concerns, and to develop composition specifications around those concerns. These compositions can be used to reason about potential conflicts in the requirements and to relate requirements to architecture in semantically meaningful ways. Recent work in AORE has moved from a syntactic approach to composition, which leads to fragile compositions and increased coupling between aspect and base concerns, to a semantic composition approach, based on semantics of the natural language itself. However, such compositions are at present only informally specified, and as such formal reasoning about the requirements and the subsequent derivations are difficult. We present a formal approach to these semantic-based compositions which facilitates this reasoning. We show that the approach especially lends itself to identifying conflicts between requirements and mapping compositions to a derived architecture.",10.1109/RE.2008.42,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685667,requirements;aspect-oriented;formal;semantics;composition;natural language;temporal logic;architecture;conflict detection,8,IEEE Conferences,,N.

Requirements Capture with RCAT,,"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA",21-Nov-08,"NASA spends millions designing and building spacecraft for its missions. The dependence on software is growing as spacecraft become more complex. With the increasing dependence on software comes the risk that bugs can lead to the loss of a mission. At NASApsilas Jet Propulsion Laboratory new tools are being developed to address this problem. Logic model checking and runtime verification can increase the confidence in a design or an implementation. A barrier to the application of such property-based checks is the difficulty in mastering the requirements notations that are currently available.

To perform this level of analysis requires dynamic collaboration by a diverse group of thought leaders, as well as input from the wider community that will share the responsibility for carrying out the mission from start through release and into field support. When the influx of feedback and ideas is not limited or restricted, more perspectives and backgrounds can be leveraged to make the more comprehensive predictions and fine tuning that are required of a cohesive strategic roadmap.

Requirements Engineering – Industry Needs,,"Vector Consulting Services, Germany; University of Colorado, USA",21-Nov-08,"Requirements engineering is recognized as one of the most critical parts of the software development life cycle. The goal of RE is to develop good-not perfect-requirements and to manage them during development with respect to risks and quality. RE is the discipline within systems and software engineering that bridges the entire life cycle and thus determines success or failure of a product or project. From a business perspective, it is what makes the difference between a winning product and a mere set of features. Good requirements engineering practices in industry are critical to succeed-and survive-in ever-changing markets. Current trends are making effective requirements practices even more important. First, the demand for high quality and reliable software is growing rapidly. Second, we see an increasing number of projects being developed with different suppliers having a multitude of stakeholders with different needs and ambitions that have to cooperate to achieve a shared objective. Last but not least, global delivery models rely on the ability to efficiently distribute the software life cycle across locations.",10.1109/RE.2008.64,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685686,requirements engineering;industry needs,2,IEEE Conferences,,C.

In particular, some people argue that scenarios/ use cases should be concrete, as in story-telling. Others argue for use of ""essential"" use cases as a methodological approach to interaction and user-interface design. Somewhat in the middle, it is argued that use cases should help acquiring the requirements in the first place. What should the practitioner believe and, in particular, do, in order to develop useful and usable software and systems? Software development and interaction design require different skills and different methods and are typically done by different people. Still, scenario-based design is proposed for several activities relevant for both tasks, such as requirements elicitation, software design, and interaction design. Symbolic modeling in this spirit is actually common to various fields. However, scenario-based approaches vary, especially with regard to their use, e.g., employing abstract use cases or integrating scenarios with functions and goals in a systematic design process. So, the key issue to be raised at the panel is how to combine different approaches, e.g., in scenario-based development, so that the interaction design as well as the development of the user interface and of the software internally result in an overall useful and useable system.",10.1109/RE.2008.59,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685687,Requirements engineering;interaction design;scenarios;use cases,4,IEEE Conferences,,H.

Such transformations assure the traceability between requirements and the necessary multidimensional elements, because the goal model conceptualizes why certain multidimensional elements are required by decision makers to satisfy their information needs. The main advantage is that the conceptual multidimensional model meets every goal and requirement defined in the requirement model. To support our approach, the profiling mechanism of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) has been used to adapt i* to the data warehouses domain.

Assessing the Quality of Software Requirements Specifications,,"FG Sof Tware Engineering, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hanover, Germany; FG Sof Tware Engineering, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hanover, Germany",21-Nov-08,"Software requirements specifications (SRS) are hard to compare due to the uniqueness of the projects they were created in. In practice this means that it is not possible to objectively determine if a projects SRS fails to reach a certain quality threshold. Therefore, a commonly agreed-on quality model is needed. Additionally, a large set of empirical data is needed to establish a correlation between project success and quality levels. As there is no such quality model, we had to define our own based on the goal-question-metric (GQM) method. Based on this we analyzed more than 40 software projects (student projects in undergraduate software engineering classes), in order to contribute to the empirical part. This paper contributes in three areas: Firstly, we outline our GQM plan and our set of metrics. They were derived from widespread literature, and hence could lead to a discussion of how to measure requirements quality. Practitioners and researchers can profit from our experience, when measuring the quality of their requirements. Secondly, we present our findings. We hope that others find these valuable when comparing them to their own results. Finally,we show that the results of our quality assessment correlate to project success.

Addressing Legal Requirements in Requirements Engineering,,"Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, USA; Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, USA",19-Nov-07,"Legal texts, such as regulations and legislation, are playing an increasingly important role in requirements engineering and system development. Monitoring systems for requirements and policy compliance has been recognized in the requirements engineering community as a key area for research. Similarly, regulatory compliance is critical in systems that are governed by regulations and law, especially given that non-compliance can result in both financial and criminal penalties. Working with legal texts can be very challenging, however, because they contain numerous ambiguities, cross-references, domain-specific definitions, and acronyms, and are frequently amended via new regulations and case law. Requirements engineers and compliance auditors must be able to identify relevant regulations, extract requirements and other key concepts, and monitor compliance throughout the software lifecycle. This paper surveys research efforts over the past 50 years in handling legal texts for systems development. These efforts include the use of symbolic logic, logic programming, first-order temporal logic, deontic logic, defeasible logic, goal modeling, and semi-structured representations.

How do distributed teams manage the development of requirements in environments that require significant cross-site collaboration and coordination? In this paper, we report research that used social network analysis to explore collaboration and awareness among team members during requirements management in an industrial distributed software team. Using the lens of a requirements-centred social network to group team members who work on a particular requirement, we collected data to characterize requirements-centric collaborations in a project, and to examine aspects of awareness of requirements changes within these networks. Our findings indicate organic patterns of collaboration involving considerable cross-site interaction, in which communication of changes was the most predominant reason for interaction. Although we did not find evidence that distance affects developers' awareness of remote team members who work on the same requirements, distance affected how accessible the remote colleagues were. We discuss implications for knowledge sharing and coordination of work on a requirement in distributed teams, and propose directions for the design of collaboration tools that support awareness in distributed requirements management.",10.1109/RE.2007.51,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384168,,58,IEEE Conferences,,D.

How Does Requirements Quality Relate to Project Success or Failure?,,"Tokyo Research Laboratory, IBM Research, Israel; University of Tokyo, Japan",19-Nov-07,"Our research goal is to Jind relations between requirements quality and project success. To attain the goal, we investigated 32 projects started and completed during the period of 2003-2005 in a large business application software development division of a company in Tokyo. Data of requirements specijication quality evaluated by software quality assurance teams as well as overall project pevormance data in terms of cost and time overrun were available. Requirements specijication quality data were Jirst converted into a multiple-dimensional space, each dimension corresponding to an item of the recommended structure of software requirements specijications (SRS) deJined in IEEE Std. 830-1998. We applied various statistical analysis techniques over the SRS quality data and project outcomes. Some interesting relations between requirements quality and project success or failure were found, including: 1) a relatively small set of SRS items have strong impact on project success or failure; 2) descriptions of SRS in normal projects tend to be balanced; 3) SRS descriptions in Section 1, where purpose, overview and general context of SRS are written, are rich in normal projects and poor in overrun projects; 4) when the descriptions of SRS Section 1 are poor while those of functions and product perspective are rich, the project tends to result in a cost overrun.",10.1109/RE.2007.31,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384169,,58,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Therefore, considering the users' expectations should be an integral part of modern system engineering activities. This paper shows an approach that was designed to appraise and measure the users' (future) satisfaction in an early phase of system development: the requirements engineering phase. In this phase little systematic guidance exists on how to evaluate the effects of features on user satisfaction early on, and on how to contribute the results to the development process. AMUSE (appraisal and measurement of user satisfaction), the approach presented in this paper, closes this gap. It helps requirements engineers and product managers to select the most promising features, i.e., the ones that will satisfy the user the most, already in the requirements phase.

This paper presents an approach that analyzes textual scenarios with the means of computational linguistics, identifies where communicating objects or whole actions are missing in the text, completes the missing information, and creates a message sequence chart (MSC) including the information missing in the textual scenario. Finally, this MSC is presented to the requirements analyst for validation.

Lack of an effective prioritization and triage process can lead to problems such as missed deadlines, disorganized development efforts, and late discovery of architecturally significant requirements. Existing prioritization techniques do not provide sufficient automation for large projects with hundreds of stakeholders and thousands of potentially conflicting requests and requirements. This paper therefore proposes an approach for automating a significant part of the prioritization process. The proposed method utilizes a probabilistic traceability model combined with a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster incoming stakeholder requests into hierarchical feature sets. Additional cross-cutting clusters are then generated to represent factors such as architecturally significant requirements or impacted business goals. Prioritization decisions are initially made at the feature level and then more critical requirements are promoted according to their relationships with the identified cross-cutting concerns. The approach is illustrated and evaluated through a case study applied to the requirements of the ice breaker system.",10.1109/RE.2007.63,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384176,,31,IEEE Conferences,,P.

When examining feature diagrams in the literature and from industry, we observed that the same modelling concepts are used for documenting two different kinds of variability: (1) product line variability, which reflects decisions of product management on how the systems that belong to the product line should vary, and (2) software variability, which reflects the ability of the reusable product line artefacts to be customized or configured. To disambiguate the documentation of variability, we follow previous suggestions to relate orthogonal variability models (OVMs) to feature diagrams. This paper reuses an existing formalization of feature diagrams, but introduces a formalization of OVMs. Then, the relationships between the two kinds of models are formalized as well. Besides a precise definition of the languages and the links, the important benefit of this formalization is that it serves as a foundation for a tool supporting automated reasoning on variability. This tool can, e.g., analyse whether the product line artefacts are flexible enough to build all the systems that should belong to the product line.",10.1109/RE.2007.61,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384187,,107,IEEE Conferences,,A.

In particular, the mobile games must satisfy a number of critical non-functional requirements (e.g. portability, gameplay, emotional issues). In addition to that, mobile games are developed for mass market, demanding from the development team to understand the requirements of very diverse and sometimes unknown groups of stakeholders. This paper presents the experience of meantime, a global mobile game developing company, in conducting requirements engineering activities during the development of the Frogman game.

The idea behind PLM is to focus on artifacts that are shared and that vary from one product to the other, so as to facilitate reuse and adaptation. Gains are expected in terms of time to market, consistency across products, easier identification of requirements for future products, costs reduction, better flexibility, and better management of change requirements. While most of the recent research works are focusing on methods and modeling techniques, little has been done so far with respect to PLM tools and their ability to answer industry needs. A study was thus undertaken in collaboration with a group of industrials to evaluate existing PLM tools. The purpose of the study was twofold: to understand the salient characteristics of PLM tools, and to evaluate the ability of existing tools to satisfy the expectations of industrials. The study was conducted using (a) a state of the art of PLM methods, (b) an analysis grid developed by the industrial partners to analyze the characteristics ofPM tools in general, and (c) interviews with our industrial partners.

Requirements Engineering using Prototyping Projects in Healthcare Diagnostic Software Applications,,"Philips Medical Systems, Bangalore, India; Philips Medical Systems, Bangalore, India",19-Nov-07,"Healthcare diagnostic applications demand state-of-art technology in order to assist the doctor to do accurate and efficient diagnoses. In order to keep pace with the latest technologies Philips Medical Systems has a competency development group which executes projects that examine the feasibility of adapting an existing product to a new technology/platform. The outcome of these projects is to evolve a set of new features in its existing applications/products which can leverage the new technology. The requirements collected at the end of this project typically drive a technology migration project.The stake holders in a competency development project typically represent different medical imaging groups unlike normal product engineering where stakeholders are the end-users. The outcome of this project in most cases may not directly result in a newly marketable product, but a product which is technologically superior, competitive and essentially one which can improve diagnostics or treatment of patient health care. As in the case of R&D projects these projects are also characterized by unclear/shifting goals. Established techniques of planning tracking and management which are applicable to most mainstream software engineering projects aren't applicable to competency development projects. In this paper we outline a well defined and managed approach to requirements engineering using competency development projects, which in effect are prototyping projects.

The result is compared with another project improving RUP to handle performance requirements. The major differences between the improvements are that 1) they suggest a special, dedicated performance manager role and we suggest that present roles are augmented, 2) they suggest a bottom-up approach to performance verification while we focus on system performance first, i.e. top-down.

A Meta Model for Iterative Development of Requirements Leveraging,,"Infosys Technologies Limited, India; Infosys Technologies Limited, India",19-Nov-07,"Some of the major issues associated with the requirements phase include ambiguity in requirements, lack of connect between Business-IT stakeholders and iterative nature of requirements development. Literature indicates that formal specifications and prototyping can assist in mitigating the above issues. However, iterative nature of the requirements lead to frequent changes in prototyping and formal specifications driving both the artifacts out of synch with each other. There is a lack of an overall framework to establish dynamic association between the elements of requirements specification and prototyping. This paper describes a meta model which associates the formal requirement specifications with prototyping. The meta model is executed with the help of a tool.

There is no perfect way to do this, but several simple techniques and rules- of thumb can be combined to do much better than seems to be usual.

Testing to Improve Requirements - Mission Impossible?,,"Grove Consultants, UK",16-Oct-06,"How is it possible that testing could help to make better requirements? If this sounds like ""mission impossible"" to you, you may be suffering under some myths or misconceptions about the relationship between requirements and testing. Requirements engineers, developers and testers all have a different mindset and this can result in misunderstandings about the relationship between them. Whether you use a traditional life cycle approach or a very iterative approach to development, both good requirements specifications and good testing practices are critical to success. In this presentation we outline the characteristics of a good relationship between requirements engineering and software testing. We then look at a number of myths or misconceptions about this relationship, for example that testing comes after a system has been developed, that testers use requirements but not vice versa, that you can't test without requirements, that testers don't actually need requirements (a tester's misconception) and others. We conclude with some tips for how to achieve better requirements through a better relationship with testing. It's not mission impossible - it's mission critical.

"Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering, Part II",,"University of Toronto, Canada and Università di Trento, Italy",16-Oct-06,"The last fifteen years have seen the rise of a new phase in software development which is concerned with the acquisition, modelling and analysis of stakeholder purposes (""goals"") in order to derive functional and nonfunctional requirements. The history of ideas and research results for this new phase was reviewed in a RE'04 keynote presentation by Axel van Lamsweerde. We revisit the topic and sketch on-going research on a number of fronts. Specifically, we discuss an agent-oriented software development methodology -- called Tropos -- that is founded on the concepts of goal, actor as well as inter-actor dependencies. We also show how goal models that characterize a space of possible solutions for meeting stakeholder goals can be used as a basis for designing high variability software. In addition, we report on early work to extend database design techniques to support the generation of a database conceptual schema from stakeholder goals.

A Case Study in Systematic Improvement of Language for Requirements,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA",16-Oct-06,"The challenges to requirements from linguistic factors are well-known. This work concerns an approach to communicating requirements with greater fidelity among stakeholders through accommodation of cognitive habits and limits. To instantiate this approach, we synthesized linguistic principles into a method to generate high-quality representations of domain concepts to form the base of a project lexicon. The representations are further organized into a knowledge base that records relationships of interest. We hypothesize that the method leads to representations free of certain faults that compromise communicative fidelity. To investigate, we executed a case study in which the method was applied to the domain semantics of a medical device. Our representations compared favorably to pre-existing versions; further, analysis of the artifact as a whole supported new assertions about the application domain. These results indicate that particular language issues can be systematically managed, and that new information is available in the process",10.1109/RE.2006.5,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704044,,12,IEEE Conferences,,K.

Generating Hierarchical State Machines from Use Case Charts,,"Information & Software Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA; Information & Software Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA",16-Oct-06,"There are many examples, in the literature, of algorithms for synthesizing state machines from scenario-based models. The motivation for these is to automate the transition from scenario-based requirements to early analysis and design models. A major challenge for such algorithms, however, is that the relationships between scenarios are usually not explicitly defined. This means that synthesis algorithms have to infer the relationships and this cannot generally be done without also inferring false positives. An alternative is to require users to explicitly give scenario relationships. The challenge here is that the additional burden placed on the user must be less than the effort saved by automatic synthesis. In this paper, we address this problem by defining a synthesis algorithm for use case charts, a language for precisely describing use cases and their relationships. Use case charts are sufficiently precise to allow the automatic generation of hierarchical state machines but retain the benefits of existing scenario-based notations by being based on UML. Use case charts provide an easy way of specifying scenario relationships but also have a formal semantics that can be used both in synthesis and to execute the use case charts. This paper presents the synthesis algorithm for use case charts and illustrates it on a significant example based on students' solutions to an analysis and design problem",10.1109/RE.2006.25,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704045,,21,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Towards Regulatory Compliance: Extracting Rights and Obligations to Align Requirements with Regulations,,"Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, USA; Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, USA; Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, USA",16-Oct-06,"In the United States, federal and state regulations prescribe stakeholder rights and obligations that must be satisfied by the requirements for software systems. These regulations are typically wrought with ambiguities, making the process of deriving system requirements ad hoc and error prone. In highly regulated domains such as healthcare, there is a need for more comprehensive standards that can be used to assure that system requirements conform to regulations. To address this need, we expound upon a process called semantic parameterization previously used to derive rights and obligations from privacy goals. In this work, we apply the process to the privacy rule from the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We present our methodology for extracting and prioritizing rights and obligations from regulations and show how semantic models can be used to clarify ambiguities through focused elicitation and to balance rights with obligations.

Our starting point is a dataset of ambiguous phrases from a requirements corpus and associated human judgements about their interpretation. We then use heuristics, based largely on word distribution information, to automatically replicate these judgements. The heuristics eliminate ambiguities which people interpret easily, leaving the nocuous ones to be analysed and rewritten by hand.

Interaction Analysis in Aspect-Oriented Models,,"Technical University Berlin, Germany; Universita degli Studi di Milano, Italy; Technical University Berlin, Germany",16-Oct-06,"Aspect-oriented concepts are currently introduced in all phases of the software development life cycle. However, the complexity of interactions among different aspects and between aspects and base entities may reduce the value of aspect-oriented separation of cross-cutting concerns. Some interactions may be intended or may be emerging behavior, while others are the source of unexpected inconsistencies. It is therefore desirable to detect inconsistencies as early as possible, preferably at the modeling level. We propose an approach for analyzing interactions and potential inconsistencies at the level of requirements modeling. We use a variant of UML to model requirements in a use case driven approach. Activities that are used to refine use cases are the join points to compose crosscutting concerns. The activities and their composition are formalized using the theory of graph transformation systems, which provides analysis support for detecting potential conflicts and dependencies between rule-based transformations. This theory is used to effectively reason about potential interactions and inconsistencies caused by aspect-oriented composition. The analysis is performed with the graph transformation tool AGG. The automatically analyzed conflicts and dependencies also serve as an additional view that helps in better understanding the potential behavior of the composed system",10.1109/RE.2006.35,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704050,,20,IEEE Conferences,,K.

Matching Antipatterns to Improve the Quality of Use Case Models,,"STEAM Laboratory, University of Alberta, Canada; STEAM Laboratory, University of Alberta",16-Oct-06,"Use case modeling is an effective technique used to capture functional requirements. Use case models are mainly composed of textual descriptions written in natural language and simple diagrams that adhere to a few syntactic rules. This simplicity can be deceptive as many modelers create use case models that are incorrect, inconsistent, and ambiguous and contain restrictive design decisions. In this paper, a new methodology is described that utilizes antipatterns to detect potentially defective areas in use case models. This paper introduces the tool ARBIUM, which will support the proposed technique and aid analysts to improve the quality of their models. ARBIUM presents a framework that will allow developers to define their own antipatterns using OCL and textual descriptions.

One issue is the gap between the conceptual models of end-users and formal specification/analysis models of developers. This paper presents a novel technique for the video analysis of scenarios, relating the use of video-based requirements to process models of software development. It uses a knowledge model-an RDF graph-based on a semiotic interpretation of film language, which allows mapping conceptual into formal models. It can be queried with RDQL, a query language for RDF. The technique has been implemented with a tool which lets the analyst annotate objects as well as spatial or temporal relationships in the video, to represent the conceptual model. The video can be arranged in a scenario graph effectively representing a multi-path video. It can be viewed in linear time order to facilitate the review of individual scenarios by end-users. Each multi-path scene from the conceptual model is mapped to a UML use case in the formal model. A UML sequence diagram can also be generated from the annotations, which shows the direct mapping of film language to UML. This sequence diagram can be edited by the analyst, refining the conceptual model to reflect deeper understanding of the application domain. The use of the software cinema technique is demonstrated with several prototypical applications. One example is a loan application scenario for a financial services consulting firm which acted as an end-user",10.1109/RE.2006.59,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704054,,32,IEEE Conferences,,O.

Understanding Business Strategies of Networked Value Constellations Using Goal- and Value Modeling,,"VU-Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; University of Namur, Namur, Belgium; University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands",16-Oct-06,"In goal-oriented requirements engineering (GORE), one usually proceeds from a goal analysis to a requirements specification, usually of IT systems. In contrast, we consider the use of GORE for the design of IT-enabled value constellations, which are collections of enterprises that jointly satisfy a consumer need using information technology. The requirements analysis needed to do such a cross-organizational design not only consists of a goal analysis, in which the relevant strategic goals of the participating companies are aligned, but also of a value analysis, in which the commercial sustainability of the constellation is explored. In this paper we investigate the relation between strategic goal- and value modeling. We use theories about business strategy such as those by Porter to identify strategic goals of a value constellation, and operationalize these goals using value models.

Feature Diagrams: A Survey and a Formal Semantics,,"Computer Science Department, University of Namur, Namur, Belgium; Computer Science Department, University of Namur, Namur, Belgium; Computer Science Department, University of Namur, Namur, Belgium",16-Oct-06,"Feature diagrams (FD) are a family of popular modelling languages used for engineering requirements in software product lines. FD were first introduced by Kang as part of the FODA (feature oriented domain analysis) method back in 1990, Since then, various extensions of FODA FD were devised to compensate for a purported ambiguity and lack of precision and expressiveness. However, they never received a proper formal semantics, which is the hallmark of precision and unambiguity as well as a prerequisite for efficient and safe tool automation, In this paper, we first survey FD variants. Subsequently, we generalize the various syntaxes through a generic construction called free feature diagrams (FFD). Formal semantics is defined at the FFD level, which provides unambiguous definition for ail the surveyed FD variants in one shot. All formalisation choices found a clear answer in the original FODA FD definition, which proved that although informal and scattered throughout many pages, it suffered no ambiguity problem. Our definition has several additional advantages: it is formal, concise and generic. We thus argue that it contributes to improve the definition, understanding, comparison and reliable implementation of FD languages",10.1109/RE.2006.23,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704057,,232,IEEE Conferences,,P. -Y.

Managing Highly Complex Product Families with Multi-Level Feature Trees,,"Fakultät IV, Lehrstuhl Softwaretechnik, Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany; DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, Berlin, Germany",16-Oct-06,"Feature trees are a well-established instrument for domain analysis and modeling. But for highly complex product families like a vehicle manufacturer's product range comprising well-above a thousand technical features - they become very large, and thus cumbersome and inflexible, especially when managing changes to the tree's structure over a long time. Furthermore, a conflict of aims arises when using feature trees in large organizations: while a single global feature tree for the entire company is desirable, local amendments for individual units or projects are indispensable in practice. In this paper, we present a detailed description of this problem and show its great relevance to the automotive domain.

We refine this step by performing a differentiated analysis factoring in relevant environmental influences. For multiple variants of a product line, the evaluation results can easily be reused by adjusting the weights of individual requirements and the relevance of different environmental situations. Taking synergies during development and production into account, a set of alternatives can then be identified which provides high performance at a low cost for the product line.

Requirement Progression in Problem Frames Applied to a Proton Therapy System,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA",16-Oct-06,"A technique is presented for obtaining a specification from a requirement through a series of incremental steps. The starting point is a problem frame description involving a requirement on the phenomena of the problem domain, and a decomposition of the environment into domains, connected to one another and to the machine being implemented by shared phenomena. In each step, the requirement is moved towards the machine, leaving behind a trail of `breadcrumbs' in the form of domain assumptions. Eventually, the transformed requirement references only phenomena at the interface of the machine and can therefore serve as a specification. Each step is justified by an implication that can be mechanically checked, ensuring that, if the machine obeys the derived specification and the domain assumptions are valid, the requirement will hold.

By using inference rules on the ontology and a quality metrics on the semantic function, an analyst can be navigated which requirements should be added for improving completeness of the current version of the requirements and/or which requirements should be deleted from the current version for keeping consistency.

Controlling the HMS Program through Managing Requirements,,"General Dynamics C4 Systems, Scottsdale, AZ, USA",16-Oct-06,"The U.S. DoD Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Handheld, Manpack, Small Form Fit (HMS) program delivers power efficient, low-cost radio sets for installation in 16 different host platforms ranging from high-performance Manpacks to disposable sensors. Aggressive cost targets are achieved through the use of a modular design resulting in a product line of radio modules that leverage open standards for maximum flexibility. This paper describes the requirement hierarchy developed for the HMS program, in which requirements flow from the system level to radio sets and then to core radio modules. A requirement management process is discussed where functional and allocated requirement baselines are controlled through a formal change control board to provide guidance and assurance that the final products meet customer expectations. Metrics are measured against the baselines as indicators of work remaining and expansion of program scope",10.1109/RE.2006.12,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704066,,1,IEEE Conferences,,D.

Optimal Solutions for Hospital Websites,,"Studies in Technology (ZIT), Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany; Kreises GmbH Public Relations, Germany; Kreises GmbH Public Relations, Germany",16-Oct-06,"Many patients today access the Internet for comprehensive hospital information and hospital selection. Yet medical expertise is not the only selection criterion for those seeking medical help. Excellent care, additional services, trust, and an appealing atmosphere in a clinic also play a role. In the competition among hospitals, the question is how a clinic should ideally present itself on the Web. What requirements must hospital Websites fulfil, and how can clinic staff find the best solutions for meeting those requirements? In this paper, we discuss our work on a Website project that was based on strategic concepts of requirements elicitation, requirements analysis and requirements negotiation. A Website for a group of clinics near Frankfurt, Germany was the result. It now includes around 1,800 Web documents on the Internet and Intranet, to which nearly 80 editors at different locations are connected. We explain the elicitation method used, the special features of negotiation, problems that occurred while creating the site and the solutions found for them, and the domain-specific social and cultural factors involved",10.1109/RE.2006.47,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704067,,3,IEEE Conferences,,K.

Good Practice and Improvement Model of Handling Capacity Requirements of Large Telecommunication Systems,,"Dept. of Computer and Information Science, Linköping University, Sweden; Ericsson AB, Linköping, Sweden; Dept. of Computer and Information Science, Linköping University, Sweden",16-Oct-06,"There is evidence to suggest that the software industry has not yet matured as regards management of nonfunctional requirements (NFRs). Consequently the cost of achieving required quality is unnecessarily high. To try and avoid this, the telecommunication systems provider Ericsson defined a research task to try and improve the management of requirements for capacity, which is one of the most critical NFRs. Linkoping University joined in the effort and conducted an interview series to investigate good practice within different parts of the company. Inspired by the interviews and an ongoing process improvement project a model for improvement was created and activities were synthesized. This paper contributes the results from the interview series, and details the subprocesses of specification that should be improved. Such improvements are about understanding the relationship between numerical entities at all system levels, augmenting UML specifications to make NFRs visible, working with time budgets, and testing the sub system level components on the same level as they are specified",10.1109/RE.2006.28,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704069,,2,IEEE Conferences,,A.

From 1969 to the present the author has assisted or led teams in the definition of requirements for a wide variety of products and systems, including music information, produce delivery, power and process control, baggage handling, mail sorting, insurance, medical device and information, communications, taxation and even race horse breeding. Often, the success or failure of the projects encountered depended on factors that were not immediately apparent to the project teams involved. At times team members would take the correct steps without realizing the consequences of a misstep. In other cases minor missteps might lead to catastrophe.

"Proving the Shalls: Requirements, Proofs, and Model-Based Development",,"Rockwell Collins, Inc., USA",16-Oct-06,"Informal requirements stated in a natural language often suffer from ambiguity, inconsistency, and incompleteness. For these reasons, the trend over the last decade has been towards the development of alternate approaches for specifying requirements such as use cases and requirement modeling languages. However, the growing popularity of model-based development and the increasing power of formal verification tools make yet another approach possible. In this approach, informal shall statements are captured as a first step in requirements elicitation. Next, an executable model of the system is constructed that is believed to implement these requirements. Simulation of this model is used to obtain early validation of the requirements with the customer and among the developers. The informal shall statements are then rewritten as formal properties over the model and shown to hold on the model. When possible, this is done through mathematical proof using model-checking or theorem proving. When formal proof is not possible, testing of the properties against the model is used. Finally, source code is automatically generated from the model. For safety or security systems, test cases are also automatically generated from the model and used to check that the object-code executing on the target platform correctly implements the model",10.1109/RE.2006.49,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704073,,2,IEEE Conferences,,S.

Re-Framing Requirements Engineering,,"Georgia Institute of Technology, USA",16-Oct-06,"Jackson's concept of ""problem frame"" has influenced requirements engineering (RE) by emphasizing the constituent problems that system requirements address. But RE is itself a problem, one that may be supported by implemented systems for which, presumably, RE is the real-world domain in which the system operates. Even when the intention is not to specify RE support technology, the concept of the problem frame illuminates the assumptions that inform much RE research and practitioner literature. This paper analyzes the contribution to RE of the major problem frames identified by Jackson. Notable RE papers are analyzed through the lens of problem frames, and it is shown that the research and professional community frequently talks at cross purposes because the problems being addressed are literally framed differently and the success criteria for RE are therefore defined in ways that do not permit comparison",10.1109/RE.2006.51,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704079,,1,IEEE Conferences,,C.

Spatial and temporal qualifiers on intent and means may also be required. We introduce emotional terrain maps, emotional intensity maps, and emotion time lines as visual mechanisms for capturing and expressing emotional requirements.

In her job as a consultant Suzanne Robertson has worked on a wide variety of projects in diverse socio-technical domains.

This talk is about these requirements exemplars - patterns to emulate - that she has distilled from experience with projects in many different cultures. The talk reviews a selection of requirements exemplars such as: requirements foundation (what's the best base?); product in parallel (two different scopes?); knowledge versus documents (which is which?); rooms with walls (why bother?); maximum disruption (why cause chaos?); linguistic integrity (what language do we speak?); eating the orange (which knife to use?); the waiting room (now or later?); and Lewis and Clark (when to explore the unknown?).

Requirements before the requirements: understanding the upstream impacts,,"Alcatel, Paris, France",14-Nov-05,"Being successful in product development means to deliver the right products or solutions at the right time for the right markets. While requirements engineering (RE) plays a key role in selecting and managing requirements for a given project, the ""upstream process"" before the project start often remains vague. Typically this upstream process is decoupled from the project related RE processes, which creates lots of project deficiencies, such as changes in requirements, and ultimately delayed release. We take the position that only by integrating upstream (e.g., roadmap) and downstream (i.e., project) processes, projects are successful. This field study is supported by data from 246 industry projects over a period of two years.

One major issue to preserve consistency is when required evolutions affect multiple aspects or components of the system at the same time. As each evolution requirement can have an impact onto several projects, teams, engineering domains, viewpoints, or system components, the question of ""is the consistency link preserved by this requirement?"" has to be continuously raised. This paper presents: (i) a framework that defines challenges for RE caused by coevolution; and (ii) an approach to solve some of these RE-related coevolution challenges.

The role of deferred requirements in a longitudinal study of emailing,,"Computer Science Department, University of Oregon, USA; Computer Information Systems Department, Georgia State University, USA; Communication Disorders and Sciences, University of Oregon, USA",14-Nov-05,"Our group has taken a clinical approach to doing requirements engineering for a specific domain: delivering email tools to the cognitively impaired population. The clinical view suggests a process that first gathers an individual's goals, assesses the individual's abilities, delivers a tailored system, and finally, monitors usage over time to look for adaptation needs. One concept that has arisen from our project is the notion of a deferred requirement (or deferred goal). Professional clinicians ask an individual to think broadly of the goals they have, and think about not only goals that are achievable today, but ones that might be striven for and become achieved in the future. We discuss this idea of deferred requirements in terms of a longitudinal study working with nine participants over a two year period.

On modelling access policies: relating roles to their organisational context,,"Department of Computing, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK; Department of Computing, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK; Department of Computing, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK",14-Nov-05,"The restriction of access is a mechanism by which organisations protect their information assets. Requirements models use actor definitions to describe users and to specify their access policies. Actors normally represent roles that users adopt, while roles can represent different things, such as a position in an organisation or the assignment of a task. Current requirements modelling approaches do not provide a systematic way of defining roles for incorporation into access policies. We address this issue by proposing a framework that facilitates the derivation of role definitions from their wider organisational context. We illustrate how our framework can be used to extend a formal version of i* - to define and verify access policies definitions -and demonstrate its applicability via a case study.",10.1109/RE.2005.48,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531037,,20,IEEE Conferences,,R.

Methodologies in this field are challenging, as they must take into account subtle notions such as trust (or lack thereof), delegation, and permission; they must also model entire organizations and not only systems-to-be. In our previous work we introduced Secure Tropos, a formal framework for modeling and analyzing security requirements. Secure Tropos is founded on three main notions: ownership, trust, and delegation. In this paper, we refine Secure Tropos introducing the notions of at-least delegation and trust of execution; also, at-most delegation and trust of permission. We also propose monitoring as a security design pattern intended to overcome the problem of lack of trust between actors.

In this paper, we describe a process called semantic parameterization that we use to derive semantic models from goals mined from privacy policy documents. We present example semantic models that enable comparing policy statements and present a template method for generating natural language policy statements (and ultimately requirements) from unique semantic models.

Risk mitigation of design requirements using a probabilistic analysis,,"NAVSEA Naval Surface Warfare Center, Philadelphia, USA; NAVSEA Naval Surface Warfare Center, Philadelphia, USA; NAVSEA Naval Surface Warfare Center, Philadelphia, USA",14-Nov-05,"The definition of requirements for complex systems requires a balance between system over-design and associated risk. A severely over-designed system poses minimal risk of failing to meet the user's operational requirements, however the over-designed system poses increased risk of high costs, usability and reliability due to system complexity, and many other issues. The method proposed in this paper creates a more accurate representation of a complex system in order to determine requirements, and quantifies the risk associated with the defined requirements. The sizing of naval power transformers in electrical distribution systems requires an updated approach to quantify the risk inherent in the system requirements definition process. The proposed methodology uses a systems engineering approach, performing a probabilistic (Monte Carlo) analysis of the electrical loads powered by each, individual transformer.

The feature-orientation provides a modular way to organize requirements and a proper granularity to analyze requirements dependencies. In this approach, we care about not only static feature dependencies (i. e. refinements and constraints), but also feature dependencies at the specification level (namely influences) and, furthermore, dynamic feature dependencies (namely interactions).

Multi-dimensional separation of concerns in requirements engineering,,"Department Informática, FCT Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal; Computing Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK; Department Informática, FCT Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal",14-Nov-05,"Existing requirements engineering approaches manage broadly scoped requirements and constraints in a fashion that is largely two-dimensional, where functional requirements serve as the base decomposition with non-functional requirements cutting across them. Therefore, crosscutting functional requirements are not effectively handled. This in turn leads to architecture trade-offs being mainly guided by the non-functional requirements, so that the system quality attributes can be satisfied. In this paper, we propose a uniform treatment of concerns at the requirements engineering level, regardless of their functional, non-functional or crosscutting nature. Our approach is based on the observation that concerns in a system are, in fact, a subset, and concrete realisations, of abstract concerns in a meta concern space. One can delineate requirements according to these abstract concerns to derive more system-specific, concrete concerns. We introduce the notion of a compositional intersection, which allows us to choose appropriate sets of concerns in our multi-dimensional separation as a basis to observe trade-offs among other concerns. This provides a rigorous analysis of requirements-level trade-offs as well as important insights into various architectural choices available to satisfy a particular functional or non-functional concern.",10.1109/RE.2005.46,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531049,,69,IEEE Conferences,,A.

Facing scalability issues in requirements prioritization with machine learning techniques,,"ITC IRST, Trento, Italy; ITC IRST, Trento, Italy; ITC IRST, Trento, Italy; ITC IRST, Trento, Italy",14-Nov-05,"Case-based driven approaches to requirements prioritization proved to be much more effective than first-principle methods in being tailored to a specific problem, that is they take advantage of the implicit knowledge that is available, given a problem representation. In these approaches, first-principle prioritization criteria are replaced by a pairwise preference elicitation process. Nevertheless case-based approaches, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique, become impractical when the size of the collection of requirements is greater than about twenty since the elicitation effort grows as the square of the number of requirements. We adopt a case-based framework for requirements prioritization, called case-based ranking, which exploits machine learning techniques to overcome the scalability problem. This method reduces the acquisition effort by combining human preference elicitation and automatic preference approximation. Our goal in this paper is to describe the framework in details and to present empirical evaluations which aim at showing its effectiveness in overcoming the scalability problem.

An algebraic framework for merging incomplete and inconsistent views,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada; Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada",14-Nov-05,"View merging, also called view integration, is a key problem in conceptual modeling. Large models are often constructed and accessed by manipulating individual views, but it is important to be able to consolidate a set of views to gain a unified perspective, to understand interactions between views, or to perform various types of end-to-end analysis. View merging is complicated by inconsistency of views. Once views are merged, it is useful to be able to trace the elements of the merged view back to their sources. In this paper, we propose a framework for merging incomplete and inconsistent graph-based views. We introduce a formalism, called annotated graphs, which incorporates a systematic annotation scheme capable of modeling incompleteness and inconsistency as well as providing a built-in mechanism for stakeholder traceability. We show how structure-preserving maps can capture the relationships between disparate views modeled as annotated graphs, and provide a general algorithm for merging views with arbitrary interconnections.

The usage model: a structure for richly describing product usage during design and development,,"Intel Corporation, USA",14-Nov-05,"User-centered design plays an influential role in product differentiation, especially within competitive markets. In order for industrial designers and interaction designers to do their jobs effectively, a rich description of product usage and the resulting requirements is essential. Historically, product usage has been described in various ways, some more successful than others. Among the more common formats used to capture usage are use cases, scenarios, and concept-of-operations documents. Several years ago, the term ""usage model"" began to be used within Intel to describe product use in a stated context. While the concept of a usage model was appealing and intuitive, agreeing on its structure and content proved far more challenging. A usage model structure was established that contains three separate tiers: supporting data, overview, and usage details. This structure provides a common taxonomy across various teams and business units, allows reuse of usage model data where appropriate, and aids communication within and between product development teams. Far more than a simple collection of use cases or scenarios, the usage model provides a rich, deep picture of product usage that can be utilized by strategic planners, requirements engineers, industrial designers, architects, managers, and others throughout product planning, design, development, and validation.",10.1109/RE.2005.73,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531061,,8,IEEE Conferences,,E.

Initial lessons learned from the definition and implementation of a platform requirements engineering process at Intel Corporation,,"Intel Corporation, USA",14-Nov-05,"In many companies a communication divide exists between the disciplines of engineering, strategic planning, and marketing. The divide can be caused by various factors including conflicting goals, cultural differences and different world views. The resulting communication gaps can affect the planning and design of new products and can have a highly negative effect on requirements activities. As part of an attempt to solve this problem within Intel's Desktop Platform Group (DPG), a platform requirements engineering system has been defined and is being implemented. There are lessons learned from its early development and use that provide a foundation for success on projects of this type: 1) focus on fixing the problems deemed most important by business customers first and work outward from there; 2) develop champions at the working level to proliferate a common requirements language and requirements practices; 3) use examples to help individuals articulate process needs and necessary work products. Define standards early to support process definition; and 4) develop a system that encourages and rewards for practice and feedback to prevent defects and make the system stronger.",10.1109/RE.2005.33,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531065,,2,IEEE Conferences,,S.

The EMU, like most complex systems, faces considerable uncertainty during its service life.

Linking the business view to requirements engineering: long-term product planning by roadmapping,,"Software Business and Engineering Institute, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland; Software Business and Engineering Institute, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland; Software Business and Engineering Institute, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland",14-Nov-05,"Companies moving into the software product business and growing in size face new challenges that cannot be tackled completely with old practices. For example, the future development steps of the off-the-shelf products cannot be negotiated with just one or a few customers any more. This means that practitioners should be able to take aspects such as their company's own strategy and available market information more effectively into account in such decision-making. However, usually the company or business unit strategy is so high level that the gap to single requirements documents is far too long. Roadmapping is one technique that companies have used for long-term product planning in order to link the business view to requirements engineering (RE), and to make more business oriented product development decisions. In addition, roadmapping has been used to share a common understanding about the future development steps of products with different stakeholders. However, the application of the technique is not always easy.

RE researchers have noted time and again the difficulty of technology transfer, that of getting technology that RE research has developed and found useful to be used in industrial practice. The numerous panels we have had over the years on this subject are proof of the pervasiveness and permanence of this problem. One thing that keeps many software-development organizations from doing serious requirements engineering before beginning development is the perception that doing requirements engineering wastes time and delays getting on to the real work, designing and programming. Many a manager says, ""I know that we should work out the requirements in detail, but we don’t have time. We have to get started on the programming because we have a short deadline to deliver the code!"". He or she says this despite all the evidence out there that each day spent in thrashing out requirement details leads to a reduction of up to 10 days in development time because of the reduction in the errors programmed into the code and the resultant reduction in both programming time and testing time. A relevant quotation in this respect is that of Trevor Devon of fizer, ""Weeks of coding can save hours of planning"". When confronted with this evidence, the average manager relies on his or her gut feelings that says that if the beginning of coding is delayed by n days, then the completion of coding is delayed by more than n days. Therefore, it’s best to get started coding as soon as possible. Therefore, the first third of this panel is a series of 5- minute talks presenting anecdotal and case study evidence that upfront RE pays off big.

Once built, COTS in a domain may be evaluated with respect to the quality entities included therein, quality requirements may be stated with respect to the quality model, and the classical factor-requirement negotiation process may be used for the selection of the most appropriate COTS. Our goal is to have completely implemented in a near future a new version of the system DesCOTS (Grau et al., 2004) that supports all the above processes.

But for extremely complex product families like a vehicle manufacturer's product range, they become very large, and thus cumbersome and inflexible. This is particularly true when changes to the tree's structure have to be managed and documented over a long period of time. Furthermore, a conflict of aims arises when using feature trees in large organizations: while a single global feature tree for the entire company is desirable, local amendments are indispensable because often some applications of the feature models require amendments not visible in other application contexts. A research project at DaimlerChrysler, being conducted in cooperation with the Technical University of Berlin, has examined this problem in detail and elaborated an approach based on a distribution of the feature tree definition over several hierarchical levels. Using this approach, amendments to the feature structure can be introduced locally at first, and can later become valid in a broader context, if desired.

In Section 2, we describe our model and how it works. To put such a model into practice, we need to consider at least two scenarios. One is intra-release cycle-time, where invalidity risk is predicted at the start of the project for times between the inception and completion of the project. This would give us intra-release risk trends. The second scenario is prediction over multiple releases. This would give us a risk trend over a longer period of time.

Exploring the role of requirements engineering in improving risk management,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada; Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada",14-Nov-05,"There is limited evidence (Brooks (1987), Fosberg and Mooz (2000) and S. Robertson and J. Robertson (1999)) which supports claims in literature that requirements engineering (RE) can have positive effects on an organization's ability to manage project risk. Such evidence can serve to motivate industrial adoption of requirements engineering techniques, but it can also contribute to our understanding of the role of RE in supporting project management activities. This paper presents an analysis of the causal relationship between RE practice and benefits in risk management in one software organization that revised its RE process and enjoyed improvements in its project management activities. In particular, we present insights from our investigation of the interaction between the RE process and the processes of project planning and SQA. We found that elements of the RE process such as feature decomposition, structure documentation and traceability links improved feature sizing and enabled effective change management, contributing to improved risk management activities. These findings are useful to practitioners in similar software organizations whose product release objectives originate from a remote business unit and who currently suffer from significant feature creep.",10.1109/RE.2005.27,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531084,,2,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Prototype of the evaluation framework for functional requirements of RE-tools,,"Department of Computer and Information Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway",14-Nov-05,"For a complex activity like requirement engineering (RE), a powerful tool support is clearly useful. However, the mainstream of RE practice relies on office tools rather than targeted RE-tools (e.g. DOORS, CaliberRM, and RequisitePro). One of the reasons for not using RE-tools remains the difficulty to assess them before acquiring to organisation. Only few approaches are followed with some limited software tool support. Nor the approaches neither the tools are targeted towards the RE-tool domain; therefore, their applications are time consuming and domain knowledge demanding. Furthermore, the existing RE-tool frameworks list only RE-tool requirements which in most cases are development-oriented, and not supported by the application for the RE-tool evaluation.

Dependable cost estimates are often required by customers long before detailed analysis and design activities would produce this information during a project. A number of estimation methodologies have evolved to produce reliable cost information at an early stage in the software life-cycle, however estimation continues to be a contributor to budget blowouts. Contemporary techniques for costing requirements described as use cases are increasingly challenged as the size and complexity of the system expands. In addition, use case representations of requirements fail to directly map into structures used by project managers, leading to ongoing comparisons of individual costs that are subjective and often unrepresentative of final project expenditure. A large and complex system development project is described to demonstrate some of these problems and a potential solution is proposed to improve use case estimation.",10.1109/ICRE.2004.1335649,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335649,,6,IEEE Conferences,,K.

The study involved in-depth interviews, focus groups, a Web survey and a telephone survey with bank customers. The study allowed the identification of the most important interaction experience requirements for this multi-platform service, and how they are influenced by user profiles and service characteristics. The results also show that customer experience requirements (CERs) have a strong impact on customer choice and usage of the different service platforms and can be better captured with essential use cases (EUCs), as they are technology independent. Designing a multi-platform service interaction should therefore start with a higher level of abstraction that allows a multi-platform, customer experience and essential use case perspectives.

It is not clear what proof obligations about an aspect-oriented implementation follow from the initial aspectual requirements. This work presents PROBE, a framework for generation of proof obligations for aspect-oriented systems from the initial aspectual requirements and associated trade-offs. The abstract proof obligations are expressed in standard linear temporal logic. Key components of the framework include an extended ontology with parametric temporal formulas and functions, and extensive treatment of conflicts among requirements.

They emphasise the world outside the computer helping the developer to focus on the problem domain instead of drifting into inventing solutions. The intention is to delay consideration of the solution space until a good understanding of the problem is gained. In contrast, early consideration of a solution architecture is common practice in software development. Software is usually developed by including existing components and/or reusing existing frameworks and architectures. This has the advantage of shortening development time through reuse, and increasing the robustness of a system through the application of tried and tested solutions. In This work, we show how these two views can be reconciled and demonstrate how a choice of architecture can facilitate problem analysis, decomposition and subsequent recomposition, within the problem frames framework.

COTS tenders and integration requirements,,"IT-University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",20-Sep-04,"When buying COTS-based software, the customer has to choose between what is available.

Requirements for integrating the COTS system with other systems are particularly hard because suppliers may integrate in different ways and with different other systems. A related problem is that once the COTS system is purchased, the COTS supplier may have a de-facto monopoly. Only he can expand the system or integrate it with other systems. Experience shows that customers fail to deal with these issues adequately. As an example they may believe that asking for open interfaces is sufficient to guard them against monopoly.

We observed that the initial diffusion occurred in different social worlds, i.e. internal collectives of people with common work practices, within the organization. We describe how requirements that are present in overlaps between different social worlds accelerate the diffusion of the groupware tool eventually to the point of reaching ""critical mass"" acceptance, i.e. adoption of tools by the organizational as a whole. From an examination of the observed process, we determine and discuss seven lessons learned for applying requirements analysis to technology diffusion.",10.1109/ICRE.2004.1335676,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335676,,1,IEEE Conferences,,G.

Visual variability analysis for goal models,,"Univ. de Valladolid, Spain; NA; University of Toronto, Canada",20-Sep-04,"One of the benefits of goal-oriented requirements engineering is the possibility of conducting formal analysis in order to evaluate alternative solutions of goal models. Superficially, goal analysis seems like an optimization technique. In contrast to such techniques, however, goal analysis does not aim at optimal solutions, but rather ""good enough"" ones (Simon, 1996). Moreover, goal analysis has to blend quantitative with qualitative techniques to account for subject matters that are not readily quantifiable. The analysis of the interplay of nonfunctional softgoals and functional goals at a high level of abstraction is an important element of goal analysis for the requirements engineer, especially so when dealing with requirements variability. This work proposes a visual variability analysis technique and describes an implemented tool that supports it.",10.1109/ICRE.2004.1335677,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335677,,21,IEEE Conferences,,B.

Fluent-based animation: exploiting the relation between goals and scenarios for requirements validation,,"Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK; Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK; Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK; Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK",20-Sep-04,"Scenarios and goals are effective and popular techniques for requirements definition. Validation is essential in order to ensure that they represent what stakeholders actually want. Rather than validating scenarios and goals separately, possibly driving the elaboration of one through the validation of the other, This work focuses on exploiting the relation between goals and scenarios. The aim is to provide effective graphical animations as a means of validating both. Goals are objectives that a system is to meet. They are elaborated into a structure that decomposes declarative goals into goals that can be formulated in terms of events that can be controlled or monitored by the system. Scenarios are operational examples of system usage. The relation between scenarios and goals is established by means of fluents that describe how events of the operational description change the state of the basic propositions from which goals are expressed. Graphical animations are specified in terms of fluents and driven by a behaviour model synthesised from the operational scenarios.",10.1109/ICRE.2004.1335678,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335678,,15,IEEE Conferences,,S.

Requirements animation has been recognized to be a promising approach to support this. The principle is to simulate an executable version of the requirements model and to visualize the simulation in some form appealing to stakeholders. Most animation tools available to date simulate operational models. Such models in general do not directly reflect the objectives, constraints and assumptions stated declaratively by stakeholders. It is also not possible to focus the animation on particular portions of a complex model relevant to some specific concern. The paper describes a tool aimed at overcoming such limitations by animating goal-oriented requirements models. The tool automatically generates parallel state machines from goal operationalizations, instantiates those machines to specific instances created by users at animation time, executes them from concurrent events input by multiple users, monitors property violations at animation time, and visualizes concurrent simulations in terms of animated scenes in the domain.",10.1109/ICRE.2004.1335679,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335679,,10,IEEE Conferences,,Hung Tran Van, A. van Lamsweerde, P.

A heterogeneous solution for improving the return on investment of requirements traceability,,"School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems, De Paul University, USA; School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems, De Paul University, USA; School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems, De Paul University, USA",20-Sep-04,"This work describes a best-of-breed approach to traceability, in which the return-on-investment of the requirements traceability effort is maximized through the strategic deployment of a heterogeneous set of traceability techniques. This contrasts with typical traceability practices that tend to utilize a single technique such as a matrix or tool embedded into a requirements management package even though it may not provide the optimal solution for the traceability needs of a diverse set of requirements. The proposed solution, named TraCS (traceability for complex systems), defines project level trace strategies for categories of requirements and establishes links strategically in order to optimize returns of the traceability effort and minimize the risk inherent to software evolution. The paper provides a rationale for heterogeneous traceability, describes an extensible traceability framework, and then defines the process for establishing project level trace strategies.

Using card sorting technique to classify requirements change,,"Faculty of Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia; Faculty of Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia; School of Business Faculty of Economics & Business, University of Sydney, Australia",20-Sep-04,Requirements volatility is considered to be a major source of risk to the management of large and complex software projects. The ability to characterise the nature and origins of requirements change during software development is important and can lead organisations towards more effective management of changing requirements. This work focuses on a study to establish how practitioners classify requirements change requests. We used the card sorting method to identify categories of change requests that software developers use in practice. Card sorting is a knowledge elicitation method that is commonly used for capturing information about different ways of representing domain knowledge. This study has allowed us to get valuable insights into the way practitioners classify change requests and to understand their perspectives on classification. This classification is a valuable source of information in prioritizing change requests and assessing their impact. Our findings from the card sorting exercise further reveal that the criteria used for categorization are related to the role the practitioner plays in the software development team and the nature and extent of their responsibilities.,10.1109/ICRE.2004.1335681,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335681,,31,IEEE Conferences,,N.

Speeding up requirements management in a product software company: linking customer wishes to product requirements through linguistic engineering,,"Lund University, Sweden; University of Pisa, Italy; University of Utrecht, Netherlands; Lund University, Sweden",20-Sep-04,"Developing large complex software products aimed for a broad market involves a great flow of wishes and requirements. The former are elicited from customers while the latter are brought forth by the developing organization. These are preferably kept separated to preserve the different perspectives. The interrelationships should however be identified and maintained to enable well-founded decisions. Unfortunately, the current manual linkage is cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone. This work presents a pragmatic linguistic engineering approach to how statistical natural language processing may be used to support the manual linkage between customer wishes and product requirements by suggesting potential links. An evaluation with real requirements from industry is presented. It shows that in a realistic setting, automatic support could make linkage faster for at least 50% of the links. An estimation based on our evaluation also shows that considerable time savings are possible. The results, together with the identified enhancement, are promising for improving software quality and saving time in industrial requirements engineering.",10.1109/ICRE.2004.1335685,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335685,,7,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Requirements engineering process selection at Hewlett-Packard,,"Hewlett Packard Company, USA",20-Sep-04,"The requirements engineering (RE) processes used at Hewlett-Packard (HP) are many and varied. They range from informal to formal on projects that are short, agile, and at Internet-speed as well as long and methodical ones.

Some of the major attributes that affect HP's RE selection process include: level of understanding of the user's domain/needs, project size and complexity, schedule, resources, cost, quality expectations, project personnel expertise, development model (in-house versus outsourced), tolerance for requirements volatility, cost of requirements changes during development and after release, and the speed at which changes can be applied to the product after release. Attributes of the RE approach for two HP projects are examined in This work. The first project is agile with an Internet-speed release schedule. It is based on experience with the Web site and consumer award-winning eservices hpshopping.com organization. The other project is large, complex, and makes use of outsourced development.

To satisfy this claim necessary requirements-artefacts and abstraction levels have to be defined. Further the interrelations between different requirements-artefacts of one, and among different abstraction levels have to be analyzed and defined.

Requirements for the Internet,,"Senior Vice President, Architecture and Technology, MCI Communications Corporation, Ashburn, VA, USA",23-Sep-03,"The requirements for the Internet emerged in part from the practical experiences drawn from the development, deployment and use of the ARPANET. Each distinct network would have to stand on its own and no internal changes could be required to any such network to connect it to the Internet. Communications would be on a best effort basis. If a packet didn't make it to the final destination, it would shortly be retransmitted from the source. Black boxes would be used to connect the networks; these would later be called gateways and routers. There would be no information retained by the gateways about the individual flows of packets passing through them, thereby keeping them simple and avoiding complicated adaptation and recovery from various failure modes. There would be no global control at the operations level.",10.1109/ICRE.2003.1232730,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232730,,3,IEEE Conferences,,V. G.

In situ requirements analysis: a deeper examination of the relationship between requirements determination and project selection,,"School of Informationa and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA; School of Informationa and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA",23-Sep-03,"There has been sparse study of how requirements analysis is performed in situ, i.e. by organizations building large, complex systems. We assert that a better understanding of in situ requirements practice is necessary to improve and ground current theories of requirements analysis. We performed an empirical field study to examine in detail the issues faced by practitioners in forming and stabilizing requirements and the procedures they created to overcome them. We found that the process of requirements determination was intimately related to project selection. We further observed that these two processes were based on the interplay of 1) applied technical, project, and organizational authority with 2) design, sensemaking, and negotiation activity. The ethnography produced an idealized, grounded authority-activity model of requirements analysis and project selection. The model is a generalized form of requirements analysis-project selection for large, complex, risk adverse (highly sensitive to failure) projects. It represents a method to balance the differentiated authority of the stakeholder groups with the activities necessary to form and stabilize technology-project candidates and their related requirements. We argue that the core issues addressed in this field study are generalizable across organizations that build large, complex systems and hence, the results of this study form a basis for a general theory of requirements analysis practice.",10.1109/ICRE.2003.1232733,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232733,,3,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Acquiring and incorporating state-dependent timing requirements,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA",23-Sep-03,"Some real-time systems are designed to deliver services to objects that are controlled by external sources. Their services must be delivered on a timely basis, and the system fails when some services are delivered too late. Such a system may fail if the timing requirements, which it is designed to meet are erroneous. It may under-utilize resources and, consequently, be costly or unreliable if the requirements are too stringent. In general, the timing requirements of the system may change when the states of the objects monitored by the system change. Hence, one must identify how changes in object states call for changes in system requirements and how these changes should be incorporated in the design and implementation of the system. We first describe a methodology to determine timing requirements and to take into account of requirement changes at runtime. The method is based on several timing requirement determination schemes. Simulation data show that these schemes are effective for applications such as mobile IP hand-offs.

The second approach supports layered specifications in which partial descriptions of requirements may be elaborated on in a succession of steps; it is suitable for the incremental development of complex behavior in which ""error"" scenarios are ""layered on top of"" normative ones.

Several IR algorithms were adapted and implemented to address this problem. We evaluated our algorithms by comparing their results and performance to those of a senior analyst who traced manually as well as with an existing requirements tracing tool.

On the other hand, tabular event-based methods are well-established for specifying operational requirements for control software. They provide sophisticated techniques and tools for late analysis of software behavior models through, e.g., simulation, model checking or table exhaustiveness checks. We propose to take the best out of these two worlds to engineer requirements for control software. It presents a technique for deriving event-based specifications, written in the SCR tabular language, from operational specifications built according to the KAOS goal-oriented method. The technique consists in a series of transformation steps each of which resolves semantic, structural or syntactic differences between the KAOS source language and the SCR target language. Some of these steps need human intervention and illustrate the kind of semantic subtleties that need to be taken into account when integrating multiple formalisms.

An analytical model for requirements selection quality evaluation in product software development,,"Department of Communication Systems, Lund University, Sweden; Department of Communication Systems, Lund University, Sweden; Department of Communication Systems, Lund University, Sweden",23-Sep-03,"In market-driven development of product software, a crucial decision for each candidate requirement is whether or not to select it for implementation in the next release. We present an analytical model of the requirements selection process, which is used for reasoning about decision quality. A network of queues, with two classes of jobs, models the selection of requirements of different quality. The feasibility of model parameter estimation is validated in a survey involving product managers and system engineers. The results show that some of the respondents have made internally consistent parameter estimations, indicating that the model is relevant and its parameters understandable. It is also shown that a majority of the consistent respondents estimate that most of their implemented product requirements are incorrectly selected. The main objective of the model is to provide tools for evaluation of improvement proposals by estimating the impact of process change.",10.1109/ICRE.2003.1232757,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232757,,14,IEEE Conferences,,B.

Using convergent design processes to surface hidden ambiguity and conflict in requirements,,"Saint Elizabeths Medical Center, USA",23-Sep-03,"In a volatile and politically-charged design environment such as healthcare information systems (IS), ambiguity and conflict play significant roles in the success or failure of development efforts. However, the relationship between ambiguity and conflict is complex. Resolving ambiguity during IS requirements analysis may not readily lead to conflict resolution, since even the most innocent and well-intentioned probes for hidden requirements ambiguity can surface a lot of conflict. For example, ambiguity may concern issues as deciding which user constituency will be specifically favored or disfavored, or who will bear ultimate responsibility for system features and functionality, each of which involve potential conflicts of power and control over the project. The conflict averseness of IS designers may also impede efforts to employ techniques to reduce ambiguity, techniques in which issues involve changing traditional and controversial power structures. Ambiguity may even remain deliberately unresolved to passively suppress conflict, and crucial debates over critical assumptions never materialize. We also discuss a strategy for improving the effectiveness of developers in identifying hidden ambiguity and conflict during IS requirements specification.",10.1109/ICRE.2003.1232761,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232761,,2,IEEE Conferences,,R.

The automated extraction of requirements from UML models,,"Siemens Corporate Research, Inc., USA",23-Sep-03,"We have observed that often there is a disconnect between a UML model and the requirements of the modeled processes. This gap tends to widen as models become more complex and the extraction of detailed requirements becomes more difficult. The process by which detailed requirements are extracted from a model is fairly straightforward. Not only can the technique be used to extract requirements, but, interestingly enough, the same information that is extracted can be used to generate the task list part of a project plan, as the concrete use cases identify the pieces of software that need to be implemented. The use case model is basically an acyclic directed graph, with dependencies as vertices and use cases as nodes. In order for the extraction process to work, the use case model needs to be built following certain guidelines. For example: No dependency cycles and model continuity (e.g. a single continuous directed graph).",10.1109/ICRE.2003.1232764,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232764,,10,IEEE Conferences,,B.

With the sustained, severe reduction in the rush to new technology, this widely accepted fact has become increasingly evident in the networking industry. Customers now focus on high product quality as they strive for economy of operation. Enhancing product quality necessitates enhancing processes, which in turn can necessitate applying more accurate (and precise) measures. Finding process deviations and identifying patterns of product deficiencies are critical steps to achieving high quality products. We describe the application of quantitative process control (QPC) during early development phases to establish and maintain baseline distributions characterizing RMCM&T processes, and to monitor their evolutions. Metric baselining as described includes key metric identification, and data normalization, filtering, and categorization.

Practical lessons from 40 system integrating projects,,"Tokyo University of Technology, Tokyo, Japan; NTT Data Corporation Limited, Tokyo, Japan",23-Sep-03,"In developing an information system for a newly entered field of business, a customer cannot really finalize specifications, even if the specifications for the system have been decided and agreed on by both the customer and the system integrator (SI). To cope with this problem, the project manager (PM) of the SI evaluates each new request from a customer. The customer's requests should be evaluated in terms of their relevance to the six key project management points: price, cost, contract terms, specifications, team building and progress/quality. If the customer's request causes a change in the project's base line, such as a deadline, and it makes profitability less likely, this triggers a red card for the project. If the request may or may not adversely affect a plan, but nonetheless requires close attention, a yellow card is set. We describe the results of an analysis of the reports made by PMs of 40 projects for which negotiations with customers began from November 2001, and from which the accepted orders will be between 100 million yen (0.8 million dollars) and 12 billion yen.

In order to ensure usable systems we must ensure identification of appropriate requirements regarding these critical aspects of systems. There is a basic need for systematic approaches to reason, model and analyze usability from the early stages of the software development. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop a usable ontology or classification of measurable aspects of usability that can be used to aid in the specification of usability requirements. These ontologies should be represented in a way that facilitates their use as guidelines for the requirements elicitation process. We build on review of literature in the area of human-computer interaction and of usability engineering in developing a catalog of aspects of usability that can be considered during requirements gathering. This catalogue is used to guide the requirements engineer through alternatives for achieving usability. The approach is based on the use of the i* framework, having usability modeled as a special type of goal.",10.1109/ICRE.2003.1232786,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232786,,4,IEEE Conferences,,L.

Market driven requirements elicitation via critical success chains,,"Helsinki School of Economics, Finland; Helsinki School of Economics, Finland",23-Sep-03,"Elicitation of requirements becomes more difficult as usually consumers do not explicitly know what they want and it is difficult for them to express their ideas. To support different views of product development, such as project management and design, the method should present requirements in a 'rich enough' way to avoid overloading management but in the same time giving designers the detailed information they need. Requirements engineering should be easy to integrate to the software development process. To this end we have constructed a support environment for the method within Metaedit+ Meta CASE tool to present and manage the requirements. We have developed a new method that tries answering the complexities of development process. We based our method on critical success chains (CSC) method, that includes a top-down approach of planning but also wide participation of IS customers to get rich information.

An analyst attaches contribution values and preference values to edges and nodes of a goal graph respectively during the process for refining and decomposing the goals. The contribution value of an edge stands for the degree of the contribution of the sub-goal to the achievement of its parent goal, while the preference matrix of a goal represents the preference of the goal for each stakeholder. These values can help an analyst to choose and adopt a goal from the alternatives of the goals, to recognize the conflicts among the goals, and to analyze the impact of requirements changes. Furthermore the values on a goal graph and its structural characteristics allow the analyst to estimate the quality of the resulting requirements specification, such as correctness, unambiguity, completeness etc. The estimated quality values can suggest which goals should be improved and/or refined.

Initial industrial experience of misuse cases in trade-off analysis,,"London, UK",10-Dec-02,"Negative scenarios have long been applied in e.g. military and commercial operations planning. The negative form of the use case is the 'misuse case'. Experience has been gained in applying misuse cases to analyse requirement/design option trade-offs in a railway case study. In a trade-off workshop, a diagram is constructed showing use cases for goals held by system designers, and misuse cases for goals of hostile agents. Relationships between these goals are elicited and documented on the diagram. Experience in a railway trade-off study led to the devising of a set of relationships suited to trade-off analysis: 'threatens', 'mitigates', 'aggravates', and 'conflicts with', as well as the more general 'includes'. The result is a graphic that makes clear to nontechnical stakeholders how their requirements may conflict in the design domain. This contributed to the success of the trade-off workshop.

Long lifetime high assurance systems (HAS) present, among others, a peculiar property: evolutions are numerous. Because current standards for producing such HAS are not accurate enough regarding evolutions, we have considered that all the artefacts, which are produced during their development, should be recorded. Recording artefacts means developing an IS. By applying well-known IS principles supported by a relational database, we have considered their models, and then their exploitation. For the modelling part we have taken into account all the artefacts and their relationships, according to accurate representative UML abstract diagrams. Indeed, UML allows representing both static and dynamic aspects of any system. Because evolution management is the most difficult part of the HAS lifetime, we emphasise modelling requirements and evolutions. We show how these abstract UML meta-models and their instantiations can be used in two different ways: we have built up a Web database, which takes advantage of existing browsers, and, because recording all the artefacts is cumbersome, we have translated the abstract metamodels into a set of verification rules that allow manual checking of HAS properties such as release compatibility.",10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048509,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048509,,,IEEE Conferences,,M.

A quality-model-based approach for describing and evaluating software packages,,"Universitat Poliltècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Poliltècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain",10-Dec-02,"Selection of software packages from user requirements is a central task in software engineering. Selection of inappropriate packages may compromise business processes and may interfere negatively in the functioning of the involved organization. Success of package selection is endangered because of many factors, one of the most important being the absence of structured descriptions of both package features and user quality requirements. In this paper, we propose a methodology for describing quality factors of software packages using the ISO/IEC quality standard as a framework. Following this standard, relevant attributes for a specific software domain are identified and structured as a hierarchy, and metrics for them are chosen. Software packages in this domain can then be described in a uniform and comprehensive way. Therefore, selection of packages can be ameliorated by transforming user quality requirements into requirements expressed in terms of quality model attributes.

Requirements management in a product line scenario,,"Alcatel, Paris, France",10-Dec-02,"Summary form only given. The product line approach is a major reuse concept that has shown concrete commercial results over the past years. Product lines achieve reuse in the functionality and solution space, and thus improve quality, cycle time and cost. They are specifically promising in cases where many variants are produced almost simultaneously, such as in telecommunication systems. Though appealing, the concept is difficult to introduce specifically into an existing development environment. All too often the impacts on requirements management are not considered globally enough.

Relating software requirements and architectures using problem frames,,"Open University, UK; Open University, UK; Open University, UK; Open University, UK; Open University, UK",10-Dec-02,"Problem frames provide a means of analyzing and decomposing problems. They emphasise the world outside of the computer, helping the developer to focus on the problem domain, instead of drifting into inventing solutions. However, even modestly complex problems can force us into detailed consideration of the architecture of the solution. This is counter to the intention of the problem frames approach, which is to delay consideration of the solution space until a good understanding of the problem is gained. We therefore extend problem frames, allowing architectural structures, services and artifacts to be considered as part of the problem domain. Through a case study, we show how this extension enhances the applicability of problem frames in permitting an architecture-based approach to software development. We conclude that, through our extension, the applicability of problem frames is extended to include domains with existing architectural support.",10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048516,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048516,,59,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Are their design specifications consistent with our requirements?,,"Department of Computing, City University, London, UK; Department of Computing, City University, London, UK",10-Dec-02,"During the development of large and complex systems it is important to ensure consistency between requirements and design specifications in order to guarantee that the system being developed meets the specified requirements, or to support the reuse of existing software systems or components. We propose a knowledge base approach to assist with consistency checking of design specifications, represented as UML models, against functional requirements specifications, expressed in natural language. Our approach is goal-driven where the requirements and design specifications are represented in the knowledge base as axioms, which define goals. In order to demonstrate and evaluate the approach a prototype tool has been implemented.

Use Cases may be modeled in a graphical way (e.g. using the UML notation), mainly serving as a table of content for Use Cases. System behavior can more effectively be specified by structured natural language (NL) sentences. The use of NL as a way to specify the behavior of a system is however a critical point, due to the inherent ambiguity originating from different interpretations of natural language descriptions. We discuss the use of methods, based on a linguistic approach, to analyze functional requirements expressed by means of textual (NL) Use Cases. The aim is to collect quality metrics and detect defects related to such inherent ambiguity. In a series of preliminary experiments, we applied a number of tools for quality evaluation of NL text (and, in particular, of NL requirements documents) to an industrial Use Cases document. The result of the analysis is a set of metrics that aim to measure the quality of the NL textual description of Use Cases.

Since use cases provide a bridge from the informal descriptions gathered from user interviews to the more formal software model, use cases are being considered a prominent part of software analysis. Yet, tools to assist the development of use cases are rare, especially, in practice. Our study aims to provide use case reuse, while relying only on the semantics of UML and the diagrams typically used by analysis. We present an automated technique that provides for the assisted reuse of use cases. A software analyst defines an initial description of a use case. An automated graph-based relational learner then retrieves a set of similar use cases from a database.

Validating functional system requirements with scenarios,,"Centre for HCI Design, Department of Computation, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK; Centre for HCI Design, Department of Computation, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK",10-Dec-02,"This paper addresses the problem of requirements engineering for complex socio-technical systems where an optimal set of technology components and human operators have to be selected to achieve system goals. Goals are achieved by tasks that are expressed as operational scenarios with variations in environmental conditions. The approach taken is to develop a probabilistic model of system reliability as a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). The BBN model predicts human and machine reliabilities, given input variables representing the scenario and ranges of environmental conditions (i.e. weather, climate, etc.). A software tool, the System Reliability Analyser (SRA) is described that runs a set of scenarios against the BBN models while systematically varying the ranges of 12 input variables specifying properties of human operators such as training, technical equipment specification and environmental conditions. The tool reports human and technical equipment specifications that ""survive"" the scenario testing at a reliability level higher than a user-defined level. A case study evaluation of the tool is reported using a naval command and control domain, in which different combinations of human roles and equipment requirements specifications are automatically validated against a set of scenarios describing missile attacks on a navy frigate. The implication of using BBN technology and the SRA tool for automating socio-technical system requirements validation and optimising requirements selection in component-based systems is discussed.",10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048521,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048521,,14,IEEE Conferences,,A.

Ambiguity and what to do about it [requirements engineering],,,10-Dec-02,"A major concern of most software customers, managers, and requirements engineers is to remove ambiguity in communication of requirements and specifications. The most obvious solution is to try to anticipate all possible misunderstandings and write the requirements perfectly precisely. In practice, this does not work. This talk explains why it does not work, and offers easy, inexpensive methods for removing ambiguity - methods that anyone can do. The fundamental principle is to add redundancy, especially redundancy relating to context. High-bandwidth, informal communication is always a necessary supplement to formal, mathematical expressions. As software development is in essence the creation of formal, executable descriptions for the informal domains where our intents lie, we explore many ways to break up this process into small stages, allowing programmers and customers to detect ambiguity through real-world feedback.",10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048529,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048529,,6,IEEE Conferences,,B.

We performed a field study to examine in detail how project selection is performed and what procedural relationship, if any, exists between project selection and requirements analysis. We found, contrary to the common view of requirements engineering practice, that requirements analysis occurred in multiple parallel streams. We observed that requirements analysis helped define the initial project choices. In addition, as the project selection process progressed, each candidate project's requirements were further refined.

However, such planning is difficult when dealing with competing requirements, limited resources, and the incompleteness of information available at requirements time. A novel approach to requirements optimization is described. A requirements interaction model is executed to randomly sample the space of options. This produces a large amount of data, which is then condensed by a summarization tool. The result is a small list of critical decisions (i.e., those most influential in leading towards the desired optimum). This focuses human experts' attention on a relatively few decisions and makes them aware of major alternatives. This approach is iterative. Each iteration allows experts to select from among the major alternatives. In successive iterations the execution and summarization modules are run again, but each time further constrained by the decisions made in previous iteration. In the case study shown here, out of 99 yes/no decisions (approximately 10/sup 30/ possibilities), five iterations were sufficient to find and make the 30 key ones.",10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048537,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048537,,33,IEEE Conferences,,M.

By establishing dynamic links, capable of propagating data values and commands between requirements and performance models, it becomes possible to automate a wide range of speculative queries and to enhance the overall ability to predict the impact of change upon the performance of the system.",10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048540,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048540,,30,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Extreme programming modified: embrace requirements engineering practices,,"Poznań University of Technology, Poland; Poznań University of Technology, Poland; Poznań University of Technology, Poland; Poznań University of Technology, Poland",10-Dec-02,"Extreme programming (XP) is an agile (lightweight) software development methodology and it becomes more and more popular. XP proposes many interesting practices, but it also has some weaknesses. From the software engineering point of view the most important issues are: maintenance problems resulting from very limited documentation (XP relies on code and test cases only), and lack of wider perspective of a system to be built. Moreover, XP assumes that there is only one customer representative. In many cases there are several representatives (each one with his own view of the system and different priorities) and then some XP practices should be modified. In the paper we assess XP from two points of view: the capability maturity model and the Sommerville-Sawyer model (1997). We also propose how to introduce documented requirements to XP, how to modify the planning game to allow many customer representatives and how to get a wider perspective of a system to be built at the beginning of the project lifecycle.",10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048543,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048543,,27,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Effectiveness of elicitation techniques in distributed requirements engineering,,"Hewlett Packard Laboratories, USA; Virginia Technology, USA; Virginia Technology, USA",10-Dec-02,"Software development teams are often geographically distributed from their customers and end users. This creates significant communication and coordination challenges that impact the effectiveness of requirements engineering. Travel costs, and the local availability of quality technical staff increase the demand for effective distributed software development teams. This research reports an empirical study of how groupware can be used to aid distributed requirements engineering for a software development project. Six groups of seven to nine members were formed and divided into separate remote groups of customers and engineers. The engineers conducted a requirements analysis and produced a software requirements specification (SRS) document through distributed interaction with the remote customers. We present results and conclusions from the research including: an analysis of factors that affected the quality of the software requirements specification document written at the conclusion of the requirements process and the effectiveness of requirements elicitation techniques which were used in a distributed setting for requirements gathering.",10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048544,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048544,,60,IEEE Conferences,,W.

The impact of stakeholders' geographical distribution on managing requirements in a multi-site organization,,"University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia; University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia",10-Dec-02,"The increasing globalization of software industry demands an investigation of requirements engineering (RE) in multisite software development organizations. Requirements engineering is a task difficult enough when done locally-but it is even more difficult when cross-functional stakeholder groups specify requirements across cultural, language and time zone boundaries. This paper reports on a field study that investigated RE challenges introduced by stakeholders' geographical distribution in a multi-site organization. The goal was to examine RE practice in global software development, to formulate recommendations for improvement as well as to provide directions for future research on methods and tools. Based on the empirical evidence, we have constructed a model of how remote communication and knowledge management, cultural diversity and time differences negatively impact on requirements gathering, negotiation and specification. Findings reveal that aspects such as a lack of a common understanding of requirements, together with reduced awareness of working local context, trust level and ability to share work artifacts significantly challenge the effective collaboration of remote stakeholders in negotiating a set of requirements that satisfies geographically distributed customers. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving RE practice in this setting.",10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048545,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048545,,89,IEEE Conferences,,D. E.

Central to our approach is that we have introduced an improved product requirements management process and supporting tools on a step-by-step basis. This policy of ""evolution rather than revolution"" is necessary to build stakeholder confidence in the new approaches and not to hinder on-going product development. During this time, we have transformed the process from being one of managing documents filled with requirements to a more efficient process where the requirements are managed in a database and are published into documents for release projects. The availability of better quality product requirements at the start of a release project has contributed significantly to improved project leadtime estimation for the feasibility phase-potentially improving the time to market and human resource usage.",10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048547,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048547,,7,IEEE Conferences,,S.

On the challenges of business modeling in large-scale reengineering projects,,"Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway; Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway",06-Aug-02,"Modeling existing and future business processes is crucial to the outcome of large-scale reengineering projects. The use of parameterized or standard components does not render business models redundant, but shifts the modeling focus even more from technical aspects to the real-world business processes. In current reengineering projects, however, there is often a lack of coordination of modeling activities and the consistency of conceptual models across project activities can be threatened. There are often several models of the same phenomenon that are used by different people, in different phases, or for different purposes. This paper discusses some of the challenges of business modeling and presents a three-tier model description that explains some of the model variants found in reengineering projects. The findings from a large-scale SAP project in Europe underline the importance of a balanced business model and show how individually tailored conceptual models may hamper the formation of a common understanding of the domain and badly affect the reengineering of the business processes.",10.1109/ICRE.2000.855569,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855569,,3,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Special emphasis is placed on constructing problem domain models in order to build a common understanding of the problem context, to situate user requirements with reference to it, and as a technique for user requirements refinement. Another aspect highlighted by the process framework is the separation of the elicitation, analysis and refinement of user requirements from the construction of a system or software specification.

Rather than using separate tools for each notation, we advocate combining the parts semantically for tool-based analysis. We describe a framework for integrating notations from four distinct categories, namely ""models"", ""events"", ""actions, and ""expressions"". The categories allow us to view the notations independently but in a manner whereby they can be combined to create a specification. The categories are implemented as types in higher-order logic. Typechecking ensures conformance to the rules for combining notations. Our choice of higher-order logic as a base formalism allows the framework to support notations with uninterpreted constants. With our framework, it is possible to use new combinations of notations without changing existing notations or rebuilding formal analysis tools such as model checkers.",10.1109/ICRE.2000.855583,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855583,,6,IEEE Conferences,,N.

A lightweight approach to consistency of scenarios and class models,,"Institut fur Informatik, Universitat Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",06-Aug-02,"Today, object-oriented requirements specifications typically combine a scenario (or use case) model and a class model for expressing functional requirements. With any such combination, the problem of consistency between these two models arises. We present a lightweight approach to consistency between a scenario model and a class model. We assume semi-formal, loosely coupled models that are complementary: scenarios model the external system behavior; the class model specifies the internal, state-dependent functionality, that cannot be expressed easily in a scenario (but is required to specify external behavior properly). We achieve consistency by minimizing overlap between the two models and by systematically cross-referencing corresponding information. We give a set of rules that can be used both for developing a consistent specification and for checking the consistency of a completed specification. Some rules can be checked automatically, the others are rules for manual inspection.",10.1109/ICRE.2000.855584,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855584,,15,IEEE Conferences,,M.

Prioritising scenario evolution,,"Joint Research Centre forAdvanced Systems Engineering JRCASE,CSIRO, Macquarie University, NSW, Australia",06-Aug-02,"Use cases are currently used in requirement elicitation and analysis. They describe in natural language the complete functionality of a proposed system. In most projects, the amount of detail put into eliciting and documenting a use case is usually dependent on the time and resources available. Seldom is there enough time to fully expand all the scenarios in the use cases. Thus, only a small number of the scenarios are ever fully expanded. This paper delves into the process of expanding the scenarios of use cases. The transition from use cases to OO modelling elements requires functionally decomposed use cases. Discovering possible scenarios reveals the system facilities that are needed. They also guide the discovery of all the relevant classes and objects, and exposes the range of possible system interactions in the solution domain. Thus, it is important to discover and expand the most important scenarios in the use cases. Each scenario of the high level use cases can be ranked by applying various measures from the use case model, from the stakeholders' goals, and from applying concepts and formulas from Social Network Analysis. Once the most important scenarios are detected, the elaboration of a use case can be properly directed and controlled. The technique used for ranking scenarios has been applied to the case study of developing a meeting scheduler system for JRCASE, Macquarie University.

This paper describes a harmonious combination of techniques that support such scalability. The techniques have been embodied in a NASA tool, DDP, for defect detection and prevention.

Essential and incidental complexity in requirements models,,"School of Management Information Systems, Deakin University, VIC, Australia; School of Management Information Systems, Deakin University, VIC, Australia",06-Aug-02,"A deep understanding of the complexity of the requirements model and its dynamics is critical in improving requirements engineering process management. Findings from an action research study an insightful explanation of how the complexity of the requirements model evolves over time. We argue that there are two different types of complexity of the model: the essential and incidental complexities. The essential complexity represents the inherent understanding of the problem space while the incidental complexity arises from the poor fit between the structure of the model and the structure of the world which the model aims to represent. We present a pattern for the dynamics of changes in the complexity of the requirements model. The evolution of the requirements model involves both the growth of the essential complexity throughout the discovery of the problem space and the growth and shrinkage of the incidental complexity, as the model undergoes a large number of changes. The new understanding of the complexity of the requirements model and its dynamics draws new directions for future research and forms a basis for a new approach to process management.",10.1109/ICRE.2000.855599,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855599,,3,IEEE Conferences,,L.

Certitude and rectitude,,"Computer Science Laboratory, SRI International, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA",06-Aug-02,"There is a fundamental difference between certification (which is intended to give you the feeling that someone or something is doing the right thing) and correctness (for which you hopefully have some well-founded reason to believe that someone or something is doing the right thing - with respect to appropriate definitions of what is right). Certification is typically nowhere near enough; correctness is somewhat closer to what is needed, although often unattainable in the large - that is, with respect to the entire system. However, formal demonstrations that something is correct are potentially much more valuable than loosely based certification. So, a challenge confronting us here is to endow certification - of people and of systems - with a greater sense of rigor and credibility. Overall, we urgently need to explore alternatives within the context of the entire process of development, maintenance, and continued evolution. Although lowest-common-denominator certification of conventional programmers and simplistic metrics for judging organizational competence are likely to be palliatives at best, sensible procedures for certifying requirements engineers, system engineers, software engineers, debuggers, etc., could be just one of many potentially useful steps toward instilling greater discipline into the development process - particularly for critical systems.",10.1109/ICRE.2000.855604,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855604,,,IEEE Conferences,,P.

Abstracting away detail not germane to the problem of interest leaves by definition a partial specification behind. The success of this procedure shows that it is feasible to effectively validate a partial specification with this technique. Three anomalies were found in the system.

Requirements for survivable systems must include definitions of essential and non essential services, plus definitions of new survivability services for intrusion resistance, recognition, and recovery. Survivable system requirements must also specify both legitimate and intruder usage scenarios, and survivability practices for system development, operation, and evolution.

Automated requirements management-beware HOW you use tools: an experience report,,"NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, USA; SATC Unisys, USA",06-Aug-02,"At NASA and across industry, with multiple release projects, requirement storage is a volatile, dynamic process. The skill with which a project maintains, keeps current, tracks, and traces its set of requirements affects every phase of the project's software development life cycle-including maintenance. The ability to effectively manage requirements influences, months and/or years before project completion, how, when, and how expensively completion, will take place. The Software Assurance Technology Center (SATC) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center is working to continually evaluate the requirement activities of a multi billion dollar project. This task requires that the SATC evaluate the project's tools, specifically the requirement database management tool. The objective of the paper is to identify a major failing in the use of requirement management tools that causes loss of data, loss of data integrity, and loss of tool functionality. It also shows that bringing engineers and database designers together to define tool use is mandatory; and that each discipline's experience and expertise is required for successful tool implementation. Using experiences from a NASA project, we demonstrate some potential risks when a requirement management tool is incorrectly used, and how this fatal flaw plants the seeds of requirement management destruction and consequent project overruns.

These techniques help requirements engineers face the difficult task of getting system requirements from users of whatever age, ability or background.

To detect such errors, and focus on critical ones during the development of a requirements document, we have defined Root Requirements Analysis. This simple technique is based on: generalizing requirements to form root requirements, exhaustively comparing the root requirements, and applying simple metrics to the resultant comparison matrix. Root Requirements Analysis is effective. In the case study described, the technique finds that 36 percent of the case's root requirements interactions result in problems which require further analysis. Moreover, the technique provides a specific operational procedure to guide the efficient iterative resolution of identified requirements conflicts. The process of Root Requirements Analysis itself is not specific to a particular methodology. It can be applied directly to requirements in a variety of forms, as well as to the documentation of requirements development. We took this latter approach in the case study illustrating how Root Requirements Analysis can augment the Inquiry Cycle model of requirements development.

This is illustrated by the introduction of a model based on the construction of theories, which shifts the emphasis from a technocentric view of the process, where requirements are encoded in initial forms of a system, to one focused on the human understanding of situated systems.

The tool was developed considering experience gained from successes from the Cellular Switching Product's software quality program and employing key quality factors from software industry standards such as the SEI Capability Maturity Model and IEEE Standard 830. The RQM enables an evaluation of the four key dimensions of successful requirements engineering practice: people, process, software roofs, and the product. The experiences reported and lessons learned will help others who may wish to develop a similar software quality evaluation tool.",10.1109/ICRE.1998.667816,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=667816,,1,IEEE Conferences,,R.

Transition packages: an experiment in expediting the introduction of requirements management,,"Software Engineering Institute, USA; Software Engineering Institute and Process Advantage Technology, USA; Software Engineering Institute, USA; Software Engineering Institute, USA",06-Aug-02,"We built a prototype ""transition package"" to determine if adoption of requirements management practices would be expedited by a suite of RM-specific materials for change agents. The transition package was a password-protected web site that included about 100 documents for use in both performing and introducing requirements management practices. These documents included examples, templates, checklists, and guidance materials. Three frameworks-document type, Software Capability Maturity Model Common Feature, and technology transition process model-helped users make use of the documents. This paper describes the prototype, summarizes the data gathered from an evaluation by reviewers and piloting organizations, and comments on what the data reflect about the need for and use of technology to support requirements management. Finally, the potential of this approach for improving software technology adoption and process improvement within organizations is assessed based on these experiences.",10.1109/ICRE.1998.667819,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=667819,,5,IEEE Conferences,,P.

A case study of decomposing functional requirements using scenarios,,"Siemens AG, Osterreich, Vienna, Austria; Siemens AG, Osterreich, Vienna, Austria; Mohsgasse, Vienna, Austria",06-Aug-02,"Potential users of a proposed system sometimes tend not to formulate functional requirements on that system. Rather they define requirements on the compound system that includes the proposed software/hardware as well as other objects and even people such as the users themselves. Since such requirements do not make explicit what exactly the proposed system is supposed to do, they are insufficient for developing it. We present a case study that shows how functional requirements can be successfully decomposed using scenarios. According to our approach, for each of the functional requirements on the compound system, a corresponding scenario is developed. The scenario descriptions include steps to be performed by the proposed system. For each of these steps one or more functions are developed that will enable that system to perform these steps. These functions correspond to functional requirements on the proposed system. As a consequence of our case study, we propose to use this approach for decomposing functional requirements whenever they are requirements on the compound system rather than the system that is to be built.",10.1109/ICRE.1998.667821,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=667821,,8,IEEE Conferences,,H.

NoFun can be used to define hierarchies of non-functional attributes, which can be bound to individual software components, libraries of components or (sets of) software systems. Non-functional attributes can be defined in several ways, being possible to choose a particular definition in a concrete context. Also, NoFun allows to state the values of the attributes in component implementations, and to formulate non-functional requirements over component implementations.

Ways to apply this method to extend the requirement exploration framework of Gause and Weinberg (1989) are proposed for generic design problems in any discipline to include a domain-specific process composition approach.

Acquiring COTS software selection requirements,,"Centre for Human-Computer Interface Design, City University, London, UK; Centre for Human-Computer Interface Design, City University, London, UK",06-Aug-02,"An increasing number of organisations are procuring off-the-shelf systems from commercial suppliers. However, successful selection of off-the-shelf systems to fit customer requirements remains problematic. The London Ambulance Service fiasco in 1992 is a well-known example of system failure due, at least in part, to poor product selection. New methods and techniques for requirements acquisition and product selection are needed. The authors propose a new method which integrates techniques from several disciplines in response to lessons learned from a complex commercial off-the-shelf product selection exercise undertaken by the authors. They report on a recent experience in selecting a complex commercial off-the-shelf software system to be compliant with over 130 customer requirements, and lessons learned from the experience. These lessons learned inform design of PORE (Procurement-Oriented Requirements Engineering), a template-based method for requirements acquisition. This paper reports 11 of these lessons.

The study was conducted in the domain of airline safety inspections and the objective was to define inspection indicators. The results of this study indicate that the repertory grid analysis method generates all of the attributes produced by the other two methods, that it is easy to apply in the field, and is useful without complex analysis and re-interpretation of the results.",10.1109/ICRE.1996.491424,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=491424,,12,IEEE Conferences,,E.

Extracting this information leads to clarifying customers' intent, decision rationale, and what problems have not been solved yet and remain unsolved in requirements elicitation phase. The point is how we extract speech acts from utterances and hold structurally them so as to use them afterwards. Our emphasis is on specific words (called keywords) included in utterances. These keywords can suggest what topics are discussed in the utterances and which speech acts the utterances have.

Parasitic languages for requirements,,"Defence Research Agency, Worcestershire, UK",06-Aug-02,"Computer modelling is a viable method for aiding requirements elicitation of future systems as it provides a mechanism for understanding and consolidating ideas which people can readily relate to. However a major drawback with a computer model is the capturing of its requirements for future contractual use. We put forward a method by which requirement statements can be attributed within models that allows for post compilation extraction and analysis. This approach is based on adding a parasitic language to a modelling language which strongly couples requirements to items of code, but which is transparent to the dynamic execution of the model. The paper illustrates the approach on a simple language and discusses how the approach has been incorporated within a large system modelling language.

Software requirements prioritizing,,"Soft Laboratory, Linkoping, Sweden",06-Aug-02,"The importance of candidate software requirements can vary by orders of magnitude, yet most software providers do not have accurate and efficient means for selecting among them. The paper describes a case study at Ericsson Radio Systems AB of two techniques for software requirements prioritizing as a means for determining the importance of candidate requirements, a pairwise comparison technique and a numeral assignment technique. The results from the case study indicate that the pairwise comparison technique is an efficient informative and accurate means for finding the candidate requirements importance. We therefore recommend the pairwise comparison technique for software requirements prioritizing. At Ericsson we have extended its use in other development projects.",10.1109/ICRE.1996.491435,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=491435,,83,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Quality requirements analysis in customer-centered software development,,"INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France",06-Aug-02,"An approach to nonfunctional requirements analysis for software systems is discussed. The approach is designed to refine and analyse quality requirements, to manage change and to stress customer acceptance. Our work is driven by the aim to develop a technology to enable and support customer-centered (cooperative) approaches to software development. We view quality requirements analysis essentially as an outcome of argumentation-based software design. Adopting this view, we support three claims: (1) the analysis of quality requirements is inherently intertwined in the conceptual software design process; (2) relationships among quality requirements hold in the context of a design decision for a local problem only; (3) priorities among competing requirements are sensitive to characteristics of the workplace.",10.1109/ICRE.1996.491436,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=491436,,4,IEEE Conferences,,J.

Requirements for requirements engineering techniques,,"Department of Computation, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK",06-Aug-02,"The first argument presented is that if we have a clear understanding of the objectives of the requirements engineering (RE) process then we can identify what techniques we need. No single method or technique will be sufficient. The second argument is that a key objective of the RE process is to specify a system which will ultimately be successful. Three common types of failure are examined: process failure, expectation failure and interaction failure. The third argument is that if the causes of each type of failure can be described then we will be able to identify what techniques are needed to help us avoid failure. The five common causes are described: the requirements engineering process itself, human communication within requirements, knowledge development, documentation of requirements and management. A discussion of each cause is followed by a list of the RE techniques needed.

We present our research methodology, our findings, and their implications for process and tool support. The following observations stand out. First, convergence on a common system vision was painfully slow. The major impediment to faster progress was the difficulty that the project team had in making critical allocation and interface design decisions.

Combined analysis of user interface and domain requirements,,"University of Hagen, Germany; University of Hagen, Germany; University of Hagen, Germany",06-Aug-02,"A requirements analysis method called FLUID is proposed which in contrast to conventional methods explicitly captures the requirements of direct manipulation user interfaces. The main concepts addressing the user interface requirements comprise a task model and a UIA model. The latter reveals the essential structure of the user interface and defines the basic dialog behavior, the presentation of domain model components on the screen, and links to the domain model. User interface requirements are described on a level of abstraction similar to that of conventional requirements, e.g. details of screen layout and dialog behavior are deferred to later development stages. The result of the entire requirements analysis-a combination of domain model and UIA model-serves as a basis for the further development process.

An enterprise model is described which includes organisational, as well as business process components. The mission of an enterprise will determine a number of business objectives, which are translated into quantifiable goals under constraints imposed by the business environment. These goals specify targets for the associated business processes, and are critical in constraining and scoping the requirements for information systems. By ensuring the consistency of these requirements statements against the enterprise objectives, the process of iterative construction of an SRS is enhanced. Further, the impact of changes in customer requirements, both during and after the requirements engineering phase of software development may be assessed with greater reliability.

Requirements analysis from multiple perspectives: experiences with conceptual modeling technology,,"RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany; RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany; RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany; USU GmBH, Germany; USU GmBH, Germany",06-Aug-02,"The paper discusses experiences in several commercial requirements engineering (RE) projects in augmenting an informal, teamwork oriented method with formally based computer support for the analysis and interrelation of heterogeneous perspectives. For several years, the German consulting firm USU had been working with a methodology called PFR (Presence and Future Requirements analysis). PFR is targeted towards the rapid and focused requirements capture in a setting that alternates between team workshops and distributed interviews, in order to avoid the well known problem that requirements change while they are being analyzed. PFR creates a lot of visual, partially overlapping and conflicting requirements perspectives in a very short time. The successful evolution of an RE project depends on the rapid and accurate cross analysis of these viewpoints for possible incompleteness, inconsistency, and conflicts of perception or opinion. In the past few years, meta modeling has been promoted as a step towards solving such problems. To become robust against variations of notations used in different organizations or situations, you can further abstract the different modeling languages to an axiomatic meta meta model which defines the principle concepts of ""what information systems are"". The meta data management system ConceptBase jointly manages multiple levels of abstraction and handles queries and updates across these levels.",10.1109/ICRE.1996.491447,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=491447,,2,IEEE Conferences,,H.

We have developed and experimented with an initial QARCC 1 prototype. We are using the results of the experiment to develop an improved QARCC 2 tool. From our initial experimentation, we concluded that QARCC can alert users, developers, customers, and other stakeholders to conflicts among their software quality requirements and can help them identify additional, potentially important quality requirements. We also concluded that QARCC needs further refinement to avoid overloading users with insignificant quality conflict suggestions.

An alternative approach, described in the paper, is to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to aid the development of formal descriptions from requirements expressed in controlled natural language. While many problems in NLP remain unsolved, we show that suitable extensions to existing tools provide a useful platform for detecting and resolving ambiguities.

The deliverables of an IS analysis project (carried out according to the Coad/Yourdon OO analysis method) have been presented to three opinion groups: undergraduate IS students, post-graduate IS students, and domain experts (insurance business). The results of the experiment suggest that the approach used in the project can lead to ""good"" IS models (e.g. dimension, level of detail, consistency, understandability) although there are some aspects that need to be improved.

A visual software requirements definition method,,"Data Processing Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan",06-Aug-02,The author proposes a visual software requirements definition method including the description of a visual software requirements specification (SRS) with a visual requirements language and executing the SRS. The method proposed provides a describer for defining both the shape and semantics of icons to specify the requirements as he imagines them. The method also provides for describing icons' movements as a scenario description. This scenario enables an execution of the SRS with animation. The describer can confirm his requirements by checking the animation. A visual requirements language named VRDL and tools are illustrated with examples. The visual requirements specification method proposed contributes to improve the understandability of an SRS and the easiness to write the SRS. The method also improves the correctness of the SRS.<>,10.1109/ICRE.1994.292385,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=292385,,7,IEEE Conferences,,A.

Requirements critiquing using domain abstractions,,"Centre for Human-Computer Interface Design City University, London, UK; Centre for Human-Computer Interface Design City University, London, UK",06-Aug-02,"Reusing domain abstractions representing key domain features has been shown to aid requirement specification, however their role in requirements engineering has not been investigated thoroughly. This paper proposes domain abstractions to aid requirements critiquing as well as specification, thus maximising the payoff from retrieving domain abstractions. The requirements critic is part of a prototype intelligent requirements engineering toolkit being developed as part of the Nature project, ESPRIT basic research action 6353. The critic retrieves domain abstractions to validate requirement specifications for problems including incompleteness, inconsistencies and ambiguities. Intelligent, mixed initiative dialogue between the critic and requirements engineer permits requirements critiquing at the right time and level of abstraction.<>",10.1109/ICRE.1994.292386,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=292386,,21,IEEE Conferences,,N.

A pattern matching and clustering based approach for supporting requirements transformation,,"Center for Software Systems Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA; Center for Software Systems Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA",06-Aug-02,"One problem in requirements transformation from informal prose requirements to formal specifications is natural language processing. Although natural language understanding is still not practical for general requirements processing, syntactical information is useful for concept extraction. This paper discusses the correspondence between requirements sentence structure patterns and the events/transition concepts. It addresses how this correspondence might be utilized to extract events and transitions from conditional sentences. A pattern matching and clustering based approach is proposed to support event and transition extraction. The approach first selects requirements that are likely to contain event/transition information and then groups similar requirements to extract events. Once events are identified, the original requirements are clustered based on events to identify, related transition information. The approach is simple and does not require a parser.<>",10.1109/ICRE.1994.292387,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=292387,,1,IEEE Conferences,,Jianhong Liang, J. D.

Taxonomy for requirements analysis,,"Defence Research Agency, UK; Defence Research Agency, UK; Defence Research Agency, UK",06-Aug-02,"Techniques that are claimed to be applicable to analysing requirements for software intensive systems have been available for many years, but the extent to which they address this problem for large, complex systems is open to question. The techniques tend to focus on aspects of the system that are understood by specialist system designers, rather than on the issues that concern its prospective owners and users. It is not always clear how, if at all, some of these concerns may be analysed using existing techniques. This taxonomy provides a framework for classifying techniques according to the concerns that need to be addressed and the abstract frames in which analysis might be performed. Identification of all concerns reveals analysis needs, that must be satisfied by the set of abstract frames in which aspects of the system are modelled.

System bounding issues for analysis,,"Computer Science Department, University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, IA, USA; Department of Computer Science, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA",06-Aug-02,Defining system boundaries is an important part of analysis. Bounding is a separate process from partitioning or decomposing the problem. System boundaries show what is inside and outside the system whereas partitions manage the complexity of the problem. The authors discuss the tradeoffs between early and late bounding and conclude that the bounding process should be done late or at least repeated late in analysis. Specification of system boundaries improves when as much as possible is known about the problem. Analysis techniques should contain a representation and process to support system bounding. The authors demonstrate system bounding by comparing analyses done with structured analysis (SA) and object-oriented analysis (OOA). SA techniques bound the system at the start of analysis. OOA techniques bound the system either late in analysis or not at all. A boundary identification process for late bounding is presented and demonstrated.<>,10.1109/ICRE.1994.292407,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=292407,,3,IEEE Conferences,,J. M.

A systematic literature review of requirements engineering education,,"paluno-The Ruhr Institute for Software Technology, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45127, Essen, Germany",19-May-22,"AbstractRequirements engineering (RE) has established itself as a core software engineering discipline. It is well acknowledged that good RE leads to higher quality software and considerably reduces the risk of failure or budget-overspending of software development projects. It is of vital importance to train future software engineers in RE and educate future requirements engineers to adequately manage requirements in various projects. To this date, there exists no central concept of what RE education shall comprise. To lay a foundation, we report on a systematic literature review of the field and provide a systematic map describing the current state of RE education. Doing so allows us to describe how the educational landscape has changed over the last decade. Results show that only a few established author collaborations exist and that RE education research is predominantly published in venues other than the top RE research venues (i.e., in venues other than the RE conference and journal). Key trends in RE instruction of the past decade include involvement of real or realistic stakeholders, teaching predominantly elicitation as an RE activity, and increasing student factors such as motivation or communication skills. Finally, we discuss open opportunities in RE education, such as training for security requirements and supply chain risk management, as well as developing a pedagogical foundation grounded in evidence of effective instructional approaches.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00381-9,available,"['Requirements engineering', 'Requirements engineering education', 'Systematic literature review', 'Learning outcomes', 'Pedagogy']",8Citations,Springer,,Marian Daun,Alicia M.

Privacy requirements elicitation: a systematic literature review and perception analysis of IT practitioners,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Brasília (UnB), P.O. Box 4466, Brasília, DF, CEP 70910-900, Brazil",11-Jun-22,"AbstractDuring the software development process and throughout the software lifecycle, organizations must guarantee users’ privacy by protecting personal data. There are several studies in the literature proposing methodologies, techniques, and tools for privacy requirements elicitation. These studies report that practitioners must use systematic approaches to specify these requirements during initial software development activities to avoid users’ data privacy breaches. The main goal of this study is to identify which methodologies, techniques, and tools are used in privacy requirements elicitation in the literature. We have also investigated Information Technology (IT) practitioners’ perceptions regarding the methodologies, techniques, and tools identified in the literature. We have carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the methodologies, techniques, and tools used for privacy requirements elicitation. Besides, we have surveyed IT practitioners to understand their perception of using these techniques and tools in the software development process. We have found several methodologies, techniques, and tools proposed in the literature to carry out privacy requirements elicitation. Out of 78 studies cataloged within the SLR, most of them did not verify their methodologies and techniques in a practical case study or illustrative contexts (38 studies), and less than 35% of them (26 studies) experimented with their propositions within an industry context. The Privacy Safeguard method (PriS) is the best known among the 198 practitioners in the industry who participated in the survey. Moreover, use cases and user story are their most-used techniques. This qualitative and quantitative study shows a perception of IT practitioners different from those presented in other research papers and suggests that methodologies, techniques, and tools play an important role in IT practitioners’ perceptions about privacy requirements elicitation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00382-8,,"['Privacy requirements elicitation', 'Systematic literature review', 'Methodologies', 'Techniques', 'Tools']",5Citations,Springer,,Edna Dias Canedo,Ian Nery Bandeira,Angelica Toffano Seidel Calazans,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00382-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A knowledge-driven approach for designing data analytics platforms,,"School of Computer Science, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia",19-Aug-22,"AbstractBig data analytics technologies are rapidly expanding across all industry sectors as organisations try to make analytics an integral part of their everyday decision-making. Although there are many software tools and libraries to assist analysts and software engineers in developing solutions, organisations are looking for flexible analytics platforms that can address their specific objectives and requirements. To minimise costs, such platforms also need to co-exist with existing IT infrastructures and reuse knowledge and resources already accumulated within the organisation. To address such needs, this paper proposes the Data Analytics Solution Engineering (DASE) framework—a knowledge-driven approach supported by semantic web technologies for requirements engineering, design and development of new data analytics platforms. It includes a meta-model that captures data analytics platform requirements via a Knowledge Base, a set of guidelines that organisations can follow in engineering data analytics platforms and a reference architecture that demonstrates how to use these guidelines. We evaluate the DASE framework through two case studies and demonstrate how it can facilitate knowledge-based and requirements-driven data analytics platform engineering. The resulting data analytics platforms are observed to be user friendly, easy to maintain and flexible in handling changes to requirements. This work contributes to the body of knowledge in knowledge-driven requirements engineering, and data analytics platform engineering by providing a meta-model and a reference architecture that can be tailored to different analytics application domains.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00385-5,available,"['Requirements engineering', 'Knowledge driven', 'Data analytics platform', 'Software architecture', 'Semantic web', 'Ontology']",,Springer,,Madhushi Bandara,Fethi A.

Philanthropic conference-based requirements engineering in time of pandemic and beyond,,"School of Industrial Engineering and Management, Shenkar College of Engineering, Design and Art, Ramat Gan, Israel",10-Sep-22,"AbstractAs software engineering (SE) practitioners, we can help society by using our communities of experts to address a software need of a socially conscious organization. Doing so can benefit society in the locale of a SE conference and provide access to international experts for local organizations. Furthermore, established SE researchers as well as practitioners and students have the opportunity for a unique learning experience. While the SE community has already realized the importance of addressing human values and promoting social good objectives in software development, we are unaware of previous attempts to leverage SE conferences for this activity. Conferences present an opportunity to enjoy the assembly of SE practitioners, researchers, and students for the purpose of a philanthropic endeavor. Over the past four years of running a “Requirements Engineering for Social Good” event called RE Cares, co-located with the International Conference on Requirements Engineering, we worked with the stakeholders local to the conference venue. We selected stakeholders who would not necessarily have ready access to requirements engineering, software design, and development expertise otherwise, to build software targeting “good causes.” In the last two years, this event was altered to adapt to the constraints induced by COVID-19, moving to a hybrid mode and changing many of its practices accordingly. This paper summarizes and generalizes our experiences, discussing our lessons learned in the context of the pandemic and beyond and providing a framework for conducting similar social contribution in any SE conferences in general.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00386-4,available,"['Requirements engineering', 'Philanthropic projects', 'Stakeholders', 'Pandemic', 'COVID-19', 'Hybrid events']",,Springer,,Meira Levy,Irit Hadar,Jennifer Horkoff,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00386-4,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Evaluating a privacy requirements specification method by using a mixed-method approach: results and lessons learned,,"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE, Brazil",18-Sep-22,"AbstractAlthough agile software development (ASD) has been adopted in the industry, requirements approaches for ASD still neglect non-functional requirements. Privacy has become a concern due to new user demands and data protection laws. Hence, privacy needs to be properly specified, but agile requirements engineering techniques do not explicitly represent privacy requirements and, therefore, are not able to proper analyze such requirements. In this context, Privacy Criteria Method (PCM), an approach to specify privacy in requirements activities, was proposed to produce more complete and detailed privacy requirements. By considering PCM a promising approach to be used in ASD and the importance of empirical evaluation of new methods, we have as objectives: 1 evaluate the ability of PCM to support systems analysts in specifying privacy requirements when used in conjunction with some agile specification methods; and 2 show our lessons learned in conducting empirical research based on an mix-method approach defined to empirically evaluate the suitability of a requirements specification in specifying privacy requirements. Mixed-method approach is a controlled experiment as a quantitative evaluation and a feasibility study (questionnaire and task analysis based) study as a qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The requirements specifications following PCM allow to represent privacy aspects, such as user’s personal data and the privacy mechanism that can be used to mitigate a privacy risk scenario. We also observed that some extra time is necessary to specify privacy requirements with PCM, but it does not imply a greater perceived effort. Specifications produced with PCM are of good quality and more privacy detailed. Additionally, we attest to the importance of conducting empirical research to evaluate new methods. PCM assists in specifying more complete and detailed in relation to traditional techniques used in ASD, which facilitates communication between the requirements analysts and developers.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00388-2,,"['Privacy requirements specification', 'Empirical study', 'Privacy criteria method', 'Agile software development']",1Citation,Springer,,Mariana Peixoto,Carla Silva,João Araújo,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00388-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Measuring and improving software requirements elicitation in a small-sized software organization: a lightweight implementation of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15939:2017—systems and software engineering—measurement process,,"División de Estudios de Posgrado, Universidad Tecnológica de La Mixteca, Huajuapan de León, Mexico",19-Nov-22,"AbstractRequirements engineering is one of the most important areas of software engineering because it enables practitioners to determine the characteristics and constraints of the software to be developed. Therefore, the requirements elicitation process aims to obtain a preliminary version of the requirements before their specification, but it is difficult to know if the elicited requirements have the desired attributes (i.e., these requirements are complete, correct, consistent, etc.) due to the nature of this process. There are some measures that allow requirements engineers to quantify certain aspects of the requirements elicitation process and its final product (i.e., the preliminary version of the requirements, also known as preliminary requirements), but there is no way of measuring and controlling the quality of the elicited preliminary requirements. With the aim of understanding, evaluating, and improving the activities of the requirements elicitation process, some of the existing measures for this process were analyzed and, consequently, a case study was conducted to define and implement a measurement program with a set of eight measures that are proposed in this study. This program is based on the ISO/IEC/IEEE 15939:2017—systems and software engineering—measurement process, an international standard that establishes a common process and framework for the measurement of systems and software. The measurement program corresponds to a lightweight implementation of the standard in the context of a small-sized software organization (where the size of the software staff is 11–50 people, the size of projects is 50,000–100,000 LOC, and the time spent on the projects is six to twelve months) and the obtained results showed a preliminary positive influence when obtaining high-quality preliminary requirements.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00394-4,,"['ISO/IEC/IEEE 15939:2017', 'Requirements elicitation process', 'Measurement program', 'Measures', 'Small-sized software organization']",1Citation,Springer,,C.

Non-functional requirements for machine learning: understanding current use and challenges among practitioners,,"SE Division, CSE, Chalmers, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",07-Jan-23,"AbstractSystems that rely on Machine Learning (ML systems) have differing demands on quality—known as non-functional requirements (NFRs)—from traditional systems. NFRs for ML systems may differ in their definition, measurement, scope, and comparative importance. Despite the importance of NFRs in ensuring the quality ML systems, our understanding of all of these aspects is lacking compared to our understanding of NFRs in traditional domains. We have conducted interviews and a survey to understand how NFRs for ML systems are perceived among practitioners from both industry and academia. We have identified the degree of importance that practitioners place on different NFRs, including cases where practitioners are in agreement or have differences of opinion. We explore how NFRs are defined and measured over different aspects of a ML system (i.e., model, data, or whole system). We also identify challenges associated with NFR definition and measurement. Finally, we explore differences in perspective between practitioners in industry, academia, or a blended context. This knowledge illustrates how NFRs for ML systems are treated in current practice, and helps to guide future RE for ML efforts.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00395-3,available,"['Non-functional requirements', 'NFRs', 'Qualities', 'Machine learning', 'NFR Challenges', 'Requirements engineering']",11Citations,Springer,,Khan Mohammad Habibullah,Gregory Gay,Jennifer Horkoff,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00395-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Requirements management in DevOps environments: a multivocal mapping study,,"Faculty of Engineering, University Autonomous of Guerrero, Chilpancingo, Mexico",13-Jan-23,"AbstractAttention is currently being focused on DevOps, which aims to reduce software development time by means of close collaboration between the development and operations areas. However, little effort has been made to determine the role of requirements management in DevOps. The objective of this study is to help both researchers and practitioners by providing an overview of the best practices regarding requirements engineering in DevOps and identifying which areas still need to be investigated. A multivocal mapping study has, therefore, been carried out in order to study which methodologies, techniques and tools are used to support requirements management in DevOps environments. After applying the review protocol, 37 papers from formal literature and 14 references from grey literature were selected for analysis. The general conclusions obtained after analysing these papers were that, within DevOps, more attention should be paid to: (1) the reuse of requirements in order to identify systems and software artefacts that can serve as a basis for the specification of new projects; (2) the communication of requirements between the different areas of an organisation and the stakeholders of a project; (3) the traceability of requirements in order to identify the relationship with other requirements, artefacts, tasks and processes; (4) non-functional requirements in order to identify the requirements of the operations area in the early phases of a project; and finally (5) specific requirements tools that should be seamlessly integrated into the DevOps toolchain. All these issues must be considered without ignoring the agile and continuous practices of development, operations and business teams. More effort must also be made to validate new methodologies in industry so as to assess and determine their strengths and weaknesses.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-023-00396-w,available,"['Requirements management', 'Requirements engineering', 'Agile requirements engineering', 'DevOps', 'Multivocal mapping study']",3Citations,Springer,,Rogelio Hernández,Begoña Moros,Joaquín Nicolás,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-023-00396-w,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A hybrid technique using minimal spanning tree and analytic hierarchical process to prioritize functional requirements for parallel software development,,"Faculty of Computing, Riphah International University, Lahore, Pakistan",12-Feb-23,"AbstractSoftware for large enterprises such as the enterprise resource planning (ERP) is more likely to be developed by a team of software developers where the functional requirements (FRs) are distributed in parallel developers. Therefore, development of pre-requisite FRs must be carefully timed to see which requirement is to be implemented first by assigning priority to some FRs over others, so that FRs can be made available on time to parallel developers. This research proposes a hybrid prioritization technique of minimal spanning trees (MST) and AHP called the spanning analytic hierarchical process (SAHP) for FRs prioritization by exploiting MST capability to prioritize large size software FRs with smaller pairwise comparisons but with more consistent results. Using Numerical Assignment (NA) technique, prioritized FRs from SAHP are assigned to priority groups such that top-priority groups contain high-priority FRs and low-priority groups contain low-priority FRs. low-priority group of FRs are dependent on high-priority groups. As a result, within each priority group, inter-dependencies in FRs are reduced for parallel developers. The proposed technique is evaluated on FRs of ODOO ERP and the results showed that SAHP reduces estimation time of parallel developers as compared to AHP and other techniques.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-023-00397-9,,"['Functional requirements prioritization', 'Minimal spanning trees (MST)', 'Numerical assignment (NA)', 'Analytic hierarchical process (AHP)']",1Citation,Springer,,Muhammad Yaseen,Aida Mustapha,Muhammad Arif Shah,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-023-00397-9,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
The state-of-practice in requirements specification: an extended interview study at 12 companies,,"Software and Service Engineering Group (GESSI), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Jordi Girona Num.1–3, Omega Building, Room 122, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",29-Apr-23,"AbstractRequirements specification is a core activity in the requirements engineering phase of a software development project. Researchers have contributed extensively to the field of requirements specification, but the extent to which their proposals have been adopted in practice remains unclear. We gathered evidence about the state of practice in requirements specification by focussing on the artefacts used in this activity, the application of templates or guidelines, how requirements are structured in the specification document, what tools practitioners use to specify requirements, and what challenges they face. We conducted an interview-based survey study involving 24 practitioners from 12 different Swedish IT companies. We recorded the interviews and analysed these recordings, primarily by using qualitative methods. Natural language constitutes the main specification artefact but is usually accompanied by some other type of instrument. Most requirements specifications use templates or guidelines, although they seldom follow any fixed standard. Requirements are always structured in the document according to the main functionalities of the system or to project areas or system parts. Different types of tools, including MS Office tools, are used, either individually or combined, in the compilation of requirements specifications. We also note that challenges related to the use of natural language (dealing with ambiguity, inconsistency, and incompleteness) are the most frequent challenges that practitioners face in the compilation of requirements specifications. These findings are contextualized in terms of demographic factors related to the individual interviewees, the organization they are affiliated with, and the project they selected to discuss during our interviews. A number of our findings have been previously reported in related studies. These findings show that, in spite of the large number of notations, models and tools proposed from academia for improving requirements specification, practitioners still mainly rely on plain natural language and general-purpose tool support. We expect more empirical studies in this area in order to better understand the reason of this low adoption of research results.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-023-00399-7,available,"['Requirements engineering', 'Requirements specification', 'Requirements documentation', 'Natural language requirements', 'Requirements management tools', 'Empirical studies', 'Interviews']",3Citations,Springer,,Xavier Franch,Cristina Palomares,Carme Quer,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-023-00399-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Including business strategy in model-driven methods: an experiment,,"Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Universitat Politècnica de València, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022, Valencia, Spain",10-Mar-23,"AbstractSoftware-centric organisations design a loosely coupled organisation structure around strategic objectives, replicating this design to their business processes and information systems. Nowadays, dealing with business strategy in a model-driven development context is a challenge since key concepts such as the organisation’s structure and strategic ends and means have been mostly addressed at the enterprise architecture level for the strategic alignment of the whole organisation, and have not been included into MDD methods as a requirements source. To overcome this issue, researchers have designed the LiteStrat, a business strategy modelling method compliant with MDD for developing information systems. This article presents an empirical comparison of LiteStrat and with i*, one of the most used models for strategic alignment in an MDD context. The article contributes with a literature review on the experimental comparison of modelling languages, the design of a study for measuring and comparing the semantic quality of modelling languages, and empirical evidence of the LiteStrat and i* differences. The evaluation consists of a 2 × 2 factorial experiment recruiting 28 undergraduate subjects. Significant differences favouring LiteStrat were found for models’ accuracy and completeness, while no differences in modeller’s efficiency and satisfaction were detected.

WEBAPIK: a body of structured knowledge on designing web APIs,,"Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA",14-Mar-23,"AbstractWith the rise in initiatives such as software ecosystems and Internet of Things (IoT), developing robust web Application Programming Interfaces (web APIs) has become an increasingly important practice. One main concern in developing web APIs is that they expose back-end systems and data toward clients. This exposure threatens critical non-functional requirements, such as the security of back-end systems, the performance of provided services, and the privacy of communications with clients. Although dealing with non-functional requirements during software design has been long studied, there is still little guide on addressing these requirements in web APIs. In this paper, we present WEBAPIK, a body of structured knowledge on addressing non-functional requirements in the design of web APIs. WEBAPIK is comprised of 27 distinct non-functional requirements, 37 distinct design techniques to address some of the identified requirements, and the trade-offs of 22 design techniques, presented in two forms of natural language and knowledge graphs. The design knowledge compiled in WEBAPIK is systematically extracted and aggregated from 80 heterogeneous online literature resources, including 7 books, 15 weblogs and tutorial, 5 vendor white papers, 6 design standards, and 47 research papers. These resources are systematically retrieved from two search engines of Google and Google Scholar and five research databases of Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, and ScienceDirect in two periods of March to August 2018 and August 2022. WEBAPIK gathers and structures expert and scholarly discussions to provide insight about addressing non-functional requirements in the design of web APIs. The structure brought to the design knowledge makes it amenable towards extension and creates the potential for employing it in the database of knowledge-based systems that aid software developers in design decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-023-00401-2,,"['Web APIs', 'Non-functional requirements', 'Quality attributes', 'Design patterns', 'Trade-offs', 'Software design', 'Software architecture', 'Knowledge reuse', 'Systematic review']",1Citation,Springer,,Mahsa H.

We conducted a systematic mapping study, analyzed 55 publications, and identified 29 approaches that have been published since the year 2000. We analyzed how the approaches evolved over time and how the publications and authors are influenced by each other. Furthermore, the approaches are analyzed in terms of their supported requirements engineering activities, along with the evidence provided in the publications. Additionally, we also analyzed which sustainability definitions have been used, if an iterative application of the approaches is discussed, and if the approaches also provide a tool-support for practitioners. We noticed an increase of publications on requirements engineering approaches toward sustainability in the last years, whereas a majority discuss sustainability based on the same multi-dimensional concept. Although different case studies have been already conducted, we noticed a lack of an industrial application.

When details are difficult to portray: enriching vision videos,,"Software Engineering Group, Leibniz University Hannover, Welfengarten 1, 30167, Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany",05-Sep-23,"AbstractThe creation of a shared understanding of the project vision of all relevant stakeholders is vital to the requirements engineering process. One way to create such a shared understanding is through the use of vision videos that visualize the project vision at an early project stage. However, not all functional aspects can be presented. For example, the fact that an access code is valid for only a single use can be hard to visualize. One low-effort solution could be the insertion of short texts or short audio clips. In this work, our question is twofold: What effects do short pieces of additional information have in vision videos? What are suitable ways to add this information to vision videos? To answer these research questions, we investigated three different methods of inserting additional information to vision videos in an eye tracking study. We inserted short texts either below the scene or as overlays and also investigated the addition of short audio clips. These methods were evaluated in terms of participants’ video comprehension, visual effort, cognitive load and subjective preference. The results of our study show that the pieces of additional information improve vision comprehension, thereby supporting the creation of a shared understanding. All investigated methods lead to only marginal increases of the viewers’ cognitive load. Based on our results, we derive recommendations on how to insert additional information in vision videos.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-023-00403-0,available,"['Requirements engineering', 'Eye tracking', 'Vision', 'Video']",1Citation,Springer,,Lukas Nagel,Melanie Schmedes,Maike Ahrens,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-023-00403-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
On understanding and predicting issue links,,"Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",21-Sep-23,"AbstractStakeholders in software projects use issue trackers like JIRA or Bugzilla to capture and manage issues, including requirements, feature requests, and bugs. To ease issue navigation and structure project knowledge, stakeholders manually connect issues via links of certain types that reflect different dependencies, such as Epic-, Block-, Duplicate-, or Relate- links. Based on a large dataset of 16 JIRA repositories, we study the commonalities and differences in linking practices and link types across the repositories. We then investigate how state-of-the-art machine learning models can predict common link types. We observed significant differences across the repositories and link types, depending on how they are used and by whom. Additionally, we observed several inconsistencies, e.g., in how Duplicate links are used. We found that a transformer model trained on titles and descriptions of linked issues significantly outperforms other optimized models, achieving an encouraging average macro F1-score of 0.64 for predicting nine popular link types across all repositories (weighted F1-score of 0.73). For the specific Subtask- and Epic- links, the model achieves top F1-scores of 0.89 and 0.97, respectively. If we restrict the task to predict the mere existence of links, the average macro F1-score goes up to 0.95. In general, the shorter issue text, possibly indicating precise issues, seems to improve the prediction accuracy with a strong negative correlation of \(-\) 0.73. We found that Relate-links often get confused with the other links, which suggests that they are likely used as default links in unclear cases. Our findings particularly on the quality and heterogeinity of issue link data have implications for researching and applying issue link prediction in practice.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-023-00406-x,available,"['Issue management', 'Issue tracking systems', 'Dependency management', 'Duplicate detection', 'Mining issue tracker', 'Transformer models']",1Citation,Springer,,Clara Marie Lüders,Tim Pietz,Walid Maalej,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-023-00406-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
What do we know about requirements management in software ecosystems?,,"Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",11-Oct-23,"AbstractAmong the activities in requirements engineering (RE), requirements management ensures that requirements are tracked throughout their life cycle, changes are controlled, and inconsistencies are corrected. Requirements management has become increasingly critical in new ways of developing software and emerging contexts such as software ecosystems (SECO). The changing nature of the SECO introduces complexity in requirements management and results in varied flows of emergent requirements, making managing requirements in SECO challenging. Hence, understanding how requirements management is performed in SECO can help requirements managers improve their practices. This work aims to characterize requirements management in SECO. We have conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS) to achieve this goal. We selected 29 studies using a hybrid search strategy (database search and snowballing). We defined nine characteristics of requirements management in SECO that differentiate it from requirements management in traditional software development. We identified four types of approaches to support requirements management in SECO: tool, method, model, and practice. We found that only three selected studies present an assessment of their approaches. Finally, we characterize requirements management in SECO as an open, informal, collaborative, and decentralized process involving multi-party actors susceptible to power relations.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-023-00407-w,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Requirements management', 'Software ecosystem', 'Systematic mapping study']",,Springer,,Paulo Malcher,Eduardo Silva,Davi Viana,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-023-00407-w,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
The role of informal communication in building shared understanding of non-functional requirements in remote continuous software engineering,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada",26-Oct-23,"AbstractBuilding a shared understanding of non-functional requirements (NFRs) is a known but understudied challenge in requirements engineering, primarily in organizations that adopt continuous software engineering (CSE) practices. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many CSE organizations complied with working remotely due to the imposed health restrictions; many organizations continue to work remotely while implementing business processes to facilitate team communication and productivity. In remote CSE organizations, managing NFRs becomes more challenging due to the limitations of team communication. While previous research has identified the factors that lead to a lack of shared understanding of NFRs in CSE, we still have a significant gap in understanding how CSE organizations, particularly in remote work, build a shared understanding of NFRs. We conduct a 6-month ethnography-informed case study of a remote CSE organization. We identify a number of practices for building a shared understanding of NFRs, such as validating NFRs through feedback. We also studied the practices of remote collaboration and in particular, the use and affordances offered by the collaborative workspace Gather that the organization used for remote interaction; our findings suggest that it allows for informal communications instrumental for building shared understanding.

Furthermore, we conducted further interviews to validate our findings for relevance and to gain additional insights into the shared understanding of NFRs within the organization.

Why don’t we trace? A study on the barriers to software traceability in practice,,"Zürich University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland, Technikumstrasse 9, Winterthur, 8401, Switzerland",30-Nov-23,"AbstractResearchers have proposed numerous tools, methods, and techniques for establishing and maintaining software traceability. Despite its acknowledged importance, researchers argue that traceability is still “a sought-after, yet often elusive quality in software-intensive systems”. We have little evidence regarding how creating, managing, and using traceability links vary depending on factors such as organizational contexts, software development practices, and project types. We conduct an empirical study where software development practitioners express their perception regarding the value of software traceability. Via an online survey, 55 participants provided information related to their current traceability practices and needs. Furthermore, we interviewed 14 practitioners to gain a more in-depth understanding. Our study investigates the effect of two independent variables: the software development paradigm and the type of developed software system. Among the several identified findings, our analysis reveals that, although the traceability costs are an inhibitor for adopting more mature traceability practices, the respondents believe that the expected benefits still outweigh envisioned costs. Traceability is mainly performed manually: not only are automated trace retrieval tools scarce, but their offered automation is not expected to replace human involvement.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-023-00408-9,available,"['Software traceability', 'Exploratory study', 'Agile development', 'Safety-critical systems']",,Springer,,Marcela Ruiz,Jin Yang Hu,Fabiano Dalpiaz,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-023-00408-9,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Systematic adaptation and investigation of the understandability of a formal pattern language,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany",04-Apr-24,"AbstractFormal pattern languages are used in industry to communicate and analyse requirements, as they are said to be both machine-readable and intuitively understandable for humans. The questions arise to what extent this intuitive understanding of a pattern language is in agreement with its formal semantics and whether this understanding can be increased systematically. We present two consecutive empirical experiments to address these questions. The formal semantics serves as an objective judge on the intuitive understanding. Our experiments confirm the practical usefulness of HanforPL  insofar the intuition matches the formal semantics in most practically relevant cases. They also reveal a number of edge cases where even a prior exposure to formal logic is not a guarantee for correct understanding. We present and validate systematic adjustments to the patterns, leading to several large increases in understandability but come at the cost of new, but less impactful ambiguities. We demonstrate how an inquiry on the alignment of the intuitive and formal semantics of a pattern language can help to understand and improve the language. While results regarding the understandability of HanforPL are favourable in commonly used cases, there is potential for improvement. The systematic adaption of patterns shows that small modifications may have large effects on the alignment of formal and intuitive semantics, and that modification must be considered with caution in the context of the respective pattern to avoid unintentionally adding new ambiguities.

Requirements and software engineering for automotive perception systems: an interview study,,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers and University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg
, Sweden",24-Jan-24,"AbstractDriving automation systems, including autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance, are an important safety-critical domain. Such systems often incorporate perception systems that use machine learning to analyze the vehicle environment. We explore new or differing topics and challenges experienced by practitioners in this domain, which relate to requirements engineering (RE), quality, and systems and software engineering. We have conducted a semi-structured interview study with 19 participants across five companies and performed thematic analysis of the transcriptions. Practitioners have difficulty specifying upfront requirements and often rely on scenarios and operational design domains (ODDs) as RE artifacts. RE challenges relate to ODD detection and ODD exit detection, realistic scenarios, edge case specification, breaking down requirements, traceability, creating specifications for data and annotations, and quantifying quality requirements. Practitioners consider performance, reliability, robustness, user comfort, and—most importantly—safety as important quality attributes. Quality is assessed using statistical analysis of key metrics, and quality assurance is complicated by the addition of ML, simulation realism, and evolving standards. Systems are developed using a mix of methods, but these methods may not be sufficient for the needs of ML. Data quality methods must be a part of development methods. ML also requires a data-intensive verification and validation process, introducing data, analysis, and simulation challenges. Our findings contribute to understanding RE, safety engineering, and development methodologies for perception systems.

Turning asynchronicity into an opportunity: asynchronous communication for shared understanding with vision videos,,"Software Engineering Group, Leibniz University Hannover, Welfengarten 1, 30167, Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany",15-Apr-24,"AbstractThe success of software projects depends on developing a system that satisfies the stakeholders’ wishes and needs according to their mental models of the intended system. However, stakeholders may have misaligned mental models of the same system, resulting in conflicting requirements. For this reason, a shared understanding of the project vision is essential for the success of software projects. While it is already challenging to achieve shared understanding in synchronous contexts, such as meetings, it is even more challenging when only asynchronous contexts, like messaging services, are possible. When multiple stakeholders are involved from different locations and time zones, primarily asynchronous communication occurs. The use of asynchronous communication tools for the development of a shared understanding has hardly been analyzed. In this paper, we look to turn the potential detriment of having to discuss a project vision asynchronously into an opportunity for stakeholders to achieve a shared understanding. For this purpose, we give an overview of common challenges of asynchronous communication. We also propose five concepts designed to minimize the impact of these challenges. We examine categories of asynchronous communication tools and assess their adaptability to our concepts. In a workshop, we chose three most suited representatives to include in our main experiment. In this experiment, we evaluate the adapted representatives and a prototype of our own with 30 participants. Our results show the suitability of our concepts.

Improving requirements completeness: automated assistance through large language models,,"University of Ottawa, 800 King Edward Avenue, Ottawa, ON, K1N 6N5, Canada",25-Mar-24,"AbstractNatural language (NL) is arguably the most prevalent medium for expressing systems and software requirements. Detecting incompleteness in NL requirements is a major challenge. One approach to identify incompleteness is to compare requirements with external sources. Given the rise of large language models (LLMs), an interesting question arises: Are LLMs useful external sources of knowledge for detecting potential incompleteness in NL requirements? This article explores this question by utilizing BERT. Specifically, we employ BERT’s masked language model to generate contextualized predictions for filling masked slots in requirements. To simulate incompleteness, we withhold content from the requirements and assess BERT’s ability to predict terminology that is present in the withheld content but absent in the disclosed content. BERT can produce multiple predictions per mask. Our first contribution is determining the optimal number of predictions per mask, striking a balance between effectively identifying omissions in requirements and mitigating noise present in the predictions. Our second contribution involves designing a machine learning-based filter to post-process BERT’s predictions and further reduce noise. We conduct an empirical evaluation using 40 requirements specifications from the PURE dataset. Our findings indicate that: (1) BERT’s predictions effectively highlight terminology that is missing from requirements, (2) BERT outperforms simpler baselines in identifying relevant yet missing terminology, and (3) our filter reduces noise in the predictions, enhancing BERT’s effectiveness for completeness checking of requirements.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-024-00416-3,,"['Requirements completeness', 'Natural language processing (NLP)', 'Machine learning (ML)', 'Large language models (LLMs)', 'BERT']",1Citation,Springer,,Dipeeka Luitel,Shabnam Hassani,Mehrdad Sabetzadeh,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-024-00416-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
An empirical investigation of challenges of specifying training data and runtime monitors for critical software with machine learning and their relation to architectural decisions,,"Computer Science and Engineering, University of Gothenburg and Chalmers, 40530, Göteborg, Västra Götaland, Sweden",21-Mar-24,"AbstractThe development and operation of critical software that contains machine learning (ML) models requires diligence and established processes. Especially the training data used during the development of ML models have major influences on the later behaviour of the system. Runtime monitors are used to provide guarantees for that behaviour. Runtime monitors for example check that the data at runtime is compatible with the data used to train the model. In a first step towards identifying challenges when specifying requirements for training data and runtime monitors, we conducted and thematically analysed ten interviews with practitioners who develop ML models for critical applications in the automotive industry. We identified 17 themes describing the challenges and classified them in six challenge groups. In a second step, we found interconnection between the challenge themes through an additional semantic analysis of the interviews. We explored how the identified challenge themes and their interconnections can be mapped to different architecture views. This step involved identifying relevant architecture views such as data, context, hardware, AI model, and functional safety views that can address the identified challenges. The article presents a list of the identified underlying challenges, identified relations between the challenges and a mapping to architecture views.

An approach for performance requirements verification and test environments generation,,"Software Engineering Department, Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden",13-Apr-22,"AbstractModel-based testing (MBT) is a method that supports the design and execution of test cases by models that specify the intended behaviors of a system under test. While systematic literature reviews on MBT in general exist, the state of the art on modeling and testing performance requirements has seen much less attention. Therefore, we conducted a systematic mapping study on model-based performance testing. Then, we studied natural language software requirements specifications in order to understand which and how performance requirements are typically specified. Since none of the identified MBT techniques supported a major benefit of modeling, namely identifying faults in requirements specifications, we developed the Performance Requirements verificatiOn and Test EnvironmentS generaTion approach (PRO-TEST). Finally, we evaluated PRO-TEST on 149 requirements specifications. We found and analyzed 57 primary studies from the systematic mapping study and extracted 50 performance requirements models. However, those models don’t achieve the goals of MBT, which are validating requirements, ensuring their testability, and generating the minimum required test cases. We analyzed 77 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents, extracted 149 performance requirements from those SRS, and illustrate that with PRO-TEST we can model performance requirements, find issues in those requirements and detect missing ones. We detected three not-quantifiable requirements, 43 not-quantified requirements, and 180 underspecified parameters in the 149 modeled performance requirements. Furthermore, we generated 96 test environments from those models. By modeling performance requirements with PRO-TEST, we can identify issues in the requirements related to their ambiguity, measurability, and completeness. Additionally, it allows to generate parameters for test environments.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00379-3,available,"['Model-based testing', 'Performance requirements modeling', 'Performance aspects', 'Natural language requirements']",2Citations,Springer,,Waleed Abdeen,Xingru Chen,Michael Unterkalmsteiner,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00379-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Aligning requirements and testing through metamodeling and patterns: design and evaluation,,"Departamento de Computação, Universidade Federal de São Carlos (UFSCar), SP, São Carlos, Brazil",01-Jun-22,"AbstractPoorly executed requirements engineering activities profoundly affect the deliverables’ quality and project’s budget and schedule. High-quality requirements reuse through requirement patterns has been widely discussed to mitigate these adverse outcomes. Requirement patterns aggregate similar applications’ behaviors and services into well-defined templates that can be reused in later specifications. The abstraction capabilities of metamodeling have shown promising results concerning the improvement of the requirement specifications’ quality and professionals’ productivity. However, there is a lack of research on requirement patterns beyond requirements engineering, even using metamodels as the underlying structure. Besides, most companies often struggle with the cost, rework, and delay effects resulting from a weak alignment between requirements and testing. In this paper, we present a novel metamodeling approach, called  Software Pattern MetaModel (SoPaMM), which aligns requirements and testing through requirement patterns and test patterns. Influenced by well-established agile practices, SoPaMM describes functional requirement patterns and acceptance test patterns as user stories integrated with executable behaviors. Another novelty is the evaluation of SoPaMM’s quality properties against a metamodel quality evaluation framework. We detail the evaluation planning, discuss evaluation results, and present our study’s threats to validity.

A negotiation support system for defining utility functions for multi-stakeholder self-adaptive systems,,"Institute for Software Research, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",11-Jan-22,"AbstractFor realistic self-adaptive systems, multiple quality attributes need to be considered and traded off against each other. These quality attributes are commonly encoded in a utility function, for instance, a weighted sum of relevant objectives. Utility functions are typically subject to a set of constraints, i.e., hard requirements that should not be violated by the system. The research agenda for requirements engineering for self-adaptive systems has raised the need for decision-making techniques that consider the trade-offs and priorities of multiple objectives. Human stakeholders need to be engaged in the decision-making process so that constraints and the relative importance of each objective can be correctly elicited. This paper presents a method that supports multiple stakeholders in eliciting constraints, prioritizing quality attributes, negotiating priorities, and giving input to define utility functions for self-adaptive systems. We developed tool support in the form of a blackboard system that aggregates information by different stakeholders, detects conflicts, proposes mechanisms to reach an agreement, and generates a utility function. We performed a think-aloud study with 14 participants to investigate negotiation processes and assess the approach’s understandability and user satisfaction. Our study sheds light on how humans reason about and how they negotiate around quality attributes. The mechanisms for conflict detection and resolution were perceived as very useful. Overall, our approach was found to make the process of utility function definition more understandable and transparent.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00368-y,,"['Self-adaptive systems', 'Quality attributes', 'Utility functions', 'Analytic hierarchy process', 'Blackboard architecture', 'Requirements prioritization', 'Requirements negotiation', 'Non-functional requirements']",4Citations,Springer,,Rebekka Wohlrab,David Garlan,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00368-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
On the relationship between similar requirements and similar software,,"RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, Västerås, Sweden",18-Jan-22,"AbstractRecommender systems for requirements are typically built on the assumption that similar requirements can be used as proxies to retrieve similar software. When a stakeholder proposes a new requirement, natural language processing (NLP)-based similarity metrics can be exploited to retrieve existing requirements, and in turn, identify previously developed code. Several NLP approaches for similarity computation between requirements are available. However, there is little empirical evidence on their effectiveness for code retrieval. This study compares different NLP approaches, from lexical ones to semantic, deep-learning techniques, and correlates the similarity among requirements with the similarity of their associated software. The evaluation is conducted on real-world requirements from two industrial projects from a railway company. Specifically, the most similar pairs of requirements across two industrial projects are automatically identified using six language models. Then, the trace links between requirements and software are used to identify the software pairs associated with each requirements pair. The software similarity between pairs is then automatically computed with JPLag. Finally, the correlation between requirements similarity and software similarity is evaluated to see which language model shows the highest correlation and is thus more appropriate for code retrieval. In addition, we perform a focus group with members of the company to collect qualitative data. Results show a moderately positive correlation between requirements similarity and software similarity, with the pre-trained deep learning-based BERT language model with preprocessing outperforming the other models. Practitioners confirm that requirements similarity is generally regarded as a proxy for software similarity. However, they also highlight that additional aspect comes into play when deciding software reuse, e.g., domain/project knowledge, information coming from test cases, and trace links. Our work is among the first ones to explore the relationship between requirements and software similarity from a quantitative and qualitative standpoint. This can be useful not only in recommender systems but also in other requirements engineering tasks in which similarity computation is relevant, such as tracing and change impact analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00370-4,available,"['Requirements similarity', 'Software similarity', 'Correlation', 'Perception of similarity', 'Language models']",3Citations,Springer,,Muhammad Abbas,Alessio Ferrari,Anas Shatnawi,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00370-4,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
"Causality in requirements artifacts: prevalence, detection, and impact",,"Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden",09-Feb-22,"AbstractCausal relations in natural language (NL) requirements convey strong, semantic information. Automatically extracting such causal information enables multiple use cases, such as test case generation, but it also requires to reliably detect causal relations in the first place. Currently, this is still a cumbersome task as causality in NL requirements is still barely understood and, thus, barely detectable. In our empirically informed research, we aim at better understanding the notion of causality and supporting the automatic extraction of causal relations in NL requirements. In a first case study, we investigate 14.983 sentences from 53 requirements documents to understand the extent and form in which causality occurs. Second, we present and evaluate a tool-supported approach, called CiRA, for causality detection. We conclude with a second case study where we demonstrate the applicability of our tool and investigate the impact of causality on NL requirements. The first case study shows that causality constitutes around 28 % of all NL requirements sentences. We then demonstrate that our detection tool achieves a macro-\(\hbox {F}_{1}\) score of 82 % on real-world data and that it outperforms related approaches with an average gain of 11.06 % in macro-Recall and 11.43 % in macro-Precision. Finally, our second case study corroborates the positive correlations of causality with features of NL requirements. The results strengthen our confidence in the eligibility of causal relations for downstream reuse, while our tool and publicly available data constitute a first step in the ongoing endeavors of utilizing causality in RE and beyond.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00371-x,available,"['Causality', 'Multi-case study', 'Requirements engineering', 'Natural language processing']",2Citations,Springer,,Julian Frattini,Jannik Fischbach,Daniel Mendez,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00371-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Testing software’s changing features with environment-driven abstraction identification,,"University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA",20-Sep-22,"AbstractAbstractions are significant domain terms that have assisted in requirements elicitation and modeling. To extend the assistance toward requirements validation, we present in this paper an automated approach to identifying the abstractions for supporting requirements-based testing. We select relevant Wikipedia pages to serve as a domain corpus that is independent from any specific software system. We further define five novel patterns based on part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing, and frame our candidate abstractions in the form of <key, value> pairs for better testability, where the “key” helps locate “what to test”, and the “value” helps guide “how to test it” by feeding in concrete data. We evaluate our approach with six software systems in two application domains: Electronic health records and Web conferencing. The results show that our abstractions are more accurate than those generated by a state-of-the-art technique. While the initial findings indicate our abstractions’ capabilities of revealing bugs and matching the environmental assumptions created manually, we articulate a new way to perform requirements-based testing by focusing on a software system’s changing features. Specifically, we hypothesize that the same feature would behave differently under a pair of opposing environmental conditions and assess our abstractions’ applicability to this new form of feature testing.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00390-8,available,"['Abstractions', 'Natural language', 'Environmental assumptions and conditions', 'Requirements-based testing']",4Citations,Springer,,Zedong Peng,Prachi Rathod,Nan Niu,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00390-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Explainable software systems: from requirements analysis to system evaluation,,"Software Engineering Group, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany",14-Nov-22,"AbstractThe growing complexity of software systems and the influence of software-supported decisions in our society sparked the need for software that is transparent, accountable, and trustworthy. Explainability has been identified as a means to achieve these qualities. It is recognized as an emerging non-functional requirement (NFR) that has a significant impact on system quality. Accordingly, software engineers need means to assist them in incorporating this NFR into systems. This requires an early analysis of the benefits and possible design issues that arise from interrelationships between different quality aspects. However, explainability is currently under-researched in the domain of requirements engineering, and there is a lack of artifacts that support the requirements engineering process and system design. In this work, we remedy this deficit by proposing four artifacts: a definition of explainability, a conceptual model, a knowledge catalogue, and a reference model for explainable systems. These artifacts should support software and requirements engineers in understanding the definition of explainability and how it interacts with other quality aspects. Besides that, they may be considered a starting point to provide practical value in the refinement of explainability from high-level requirements to concrete design choices, as well as on the identification of methods and metrics for the evaluation of the implemented requirements.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00393-5,available,"['Explainability', 'Explainable artificial intelligence', 'Non-functional requirements', 'Quality aspects', 'Conceptual model', 'Reference model', 'Knowledge catalogue']",7Citations,Springer,,Larissa Chazette,Wasja Brunotte,Timo Speith,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00393-5,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Assessing user stories: the influence of template differences and gender-related problem-solving styles,,"NOVA LINCS, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal",18-Sep-22,"AbstractUser stories are often used for elicitation, specification, and prioritisation of requirements. There are several user story templates, varying in their structure (particularly, in the order in which they present their elements), and also in the elements they use (namely, some user story templates include personas, while others do not). The potential benefits and shortcomings of choosing one template over another need to be understood, so that practitioners can make informed choices on the extent to which a particular user story template can affect user stories’ quality, leading to ambiguity, lack of completeness, or accidental complexity. Our goal was to analyse the differences between 4 alternative user story templates when creating and understanding user stories. In addition, we used the GenderMag framework to assess the effects of different problem-solving styles, usually associated with gender, while performing the tasks. We conducted a quasi-experiment. We asked 41 participants to perform creation and understanding tasks with the different user story templates. We measured their effectiveness using metrics of task success; their speed, with task duration; their visual effort, collected with an eye-tracker; and their perceived effort, with the NASA-TLX questionnaire. We characterised the participants’ problem-solving styles with a GenderMag questionnaire. Regarding the impact of the different templates in creating user stories, we observed statistically significant differences in some of the metrics for effectiveness, speed, and visual effort. We observed small differences in the participants’ visual effort while understanding user stories specified with different templates. Concerning the impact of different problem-solving styles, in the creation tasks, we found differences in time, visual effort, and perceived effort. Regarding understanding tasks, we observed differences in effectiveness, time, and visual effort, but not in their perceived effort. Although some templates outperformed others in a few metrics, no template obtained the best overall result. As such, we found no compelling evidence that one template is “better” than the others. This suggests the recommended template may depend on the goal we want to achieve, e.g., effectiveness or speed. The differences associated with the different problem-solving styles also suggest no overall superiority of any of those styles, hinting at a gender-neutral effect of the different templates. These preliminary conclusions should be further consolidated via the conduction of replications.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00389-1,,"['User story templates', 'Eye-tracking', 'GenderMag', 'Empirical evaluation']",,Springer,,Catarina Gralha,Rita Pereira,Miguel Goulão,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00389-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Crowd-based requirements elicitation via pull feedback: method and case studies,,"Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, The Hague, The Netherlands",20-Aug-22,"AbstractCrowd-based Requirements Engineering (CrowdRE) promotes the active involvement of a large number of stakeholders in RE activities. A prominent strand of CrowdRE research concerns the creation and use of online platforms for a crowd of stakeholders to formulate ideas, which serve as an additional input for requirements elicitation. Most of the reported case studies are of small size, and they analyze the size of the crowd, rather than the quality of the collected ideas. By means of an iterative design that includes three case studies conducted at two organizations, we present the CREUS method for crowd-based elicitation via user stories. Besides reporting the details of these case studies and quantitative results on the number of participants, ideas, votes, etc., a key contribution of this paper is a qualitative analysis of the elicited ideas. To analyze the quality of the user stories, we apply criteria from the Quality User Story framework, we calculate automated text readability metrics, and we check for the presence of vague words. We also study whether the user stories can be linked to software qualities, and the specificity of the ideas.

Box 4466, Brasília, DF, Brazil",04-Nov-22,"AbstractThe Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD) implementation has impacted activities carried out by the software development teams. Due to it, developers had to become aware of the existing techniques and tools to carry out privacy requirements elicitation. Extending our previous work, we have investigated the actions taken by organizations regarding the LGPD, specifically in software development, considering the perception of agile development teams after two years of the LGPD implementation. In addition, we also investigated the perception of an agile team regarding the practices, techniques, and tools previously cited by practitioners as potential solutions for use in this context, along with techniques already in use in the current context. We have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) and selected 36 primary studies. Furthermore, we have conducted a survey with 53 IT practitioners and semi-structured interviews with ten practitioners. The LGPD principles are known by most agile teams and are being implemented by the organizations, although the existing tools to support privacy requirements elicitation are still underused by agile teams. Moreover, agile teams consider that software requirements and software construction are the most impacted areas of knowledge by the LGPD, and most of them use user stories in privacy requirements elicitation. Our findings reveal that agile teams and Brazilian organizations are more concerned with user data privacy issues after the LGPD became effective. However, agile teams still face challenges in privacy requirements elicitation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00391-7,available,"['Privacy requirements elicitation', 'Agile teams', 'Techniques', 'Perception', 'LGPD']",4Citations,Springer,,Edna Dias Canedo,Angelica Toffano Seidel Calazans,Ian Nery Bandeira,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00391-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
How do requirements evolve during elicitation? An empirical study combining interviews and app store analysis,,"Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), National Research Council (CNR), Via G. Moruzzi 1, 56126, Pisa, Italy",23-Aug-22,"AbstractRequirements are elicited from the customer and other stakeholders through an iterative process of interviews, prototyping, and other interactive sessions. Then, requirements can be further extended, based on the analysis of the features of competing products available on the market. Understanding how this process takes place can help to identify the contribution of the different elicitation phases, thereby allowing requirements analysts to better distribute their resources. In this work, we empirically study in which way requirements get transformed from initial ideas into documented needs, and then evolve based on the inspiration coming from similar products. To this end, we select 30 subjects that act as requirements analysts, and we perform interview-based elicitation sessions with a fictional customer. After the sessions, the analysts produce a first set of requirements for the system. Then, they are required to search similar products in the app stores and extend the requirements, inspired by the identified apps. The requirements documented at each step are evaluated, to assess to which extent and in which way the initial idea evolved throughout the process. Our results show that only between 30% and 38% of the requirements produced after the interviews include content that can be fully traced to initial customer’s ideas. The rest of the content is dedicated to new requirements, and up to 21% of it belongs to completely novel topics. Furthermore, up to 42% of the requirements inspired by the app stores cover additional features compared to the ones identified after the interviews. The results empirically show that requirements are not elicited in strict sense, but actually co-created through interviews, with analysts playing a crucial role in the process. In addition, we show evidence that app store-inspired elicitation can be particularly beneficial to complete the requirements.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00383-7,available,"['Requirements engineering', 'Requirements elicitation', 'Interviews', 'App store', 'User stories', 'App store-inspired elicitation']",5Citations,Springer,,Alessio Ferrari,Paola Spoletini,Sourav Debnath,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00383-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Catalog of invisibility correlations for UbiComp and IoT applications,,"Computer Science Department (DC), Group of Computer Networks, Software Engineering and Systems (GREat), Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, Brazil",25-Nov-21,"AbstractThe advance of Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) and Internet of Things (IoT) brought a new set of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), especially related to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Invisibility is one of these NFRs and refers to either the merging of technology in the user environment or the decrease in the interaction workload. This new NFR may impact traditional ones (e.g., Usability), revealing positive correlations, when one NFR helps another, and negative correlations, when a procedure favors an NFR but creates difficulty for another one. Correlations between NFRs are usually stored in catalogs, which is a well-defined body of knowledge gathered from previous experience. Although Invisibility has been recently cataloged with development strategies, the literature still lacks catalogs with correlations for this NFR. Therefore, this work aims at capturing and cataloging invisibility correlations for UbiComp and IoT systems. To do that, we also propose to systematize the definition of correlations using the following well-defined research methods: Interview, Content Analysis and Questionnaire. As a result, we defined a catalog with 110 positive and negative correlations with 9 NFRs. We evaluated this correlation catalog using a controlled experiment to verify if it helps developers when they are making decisions about NFRs in UbiComp and IoT systems. Results indicated that the catalog improved the decisions made by the participants. Therefore, this well-defined body of knowledge is useful for supporting software engineers to select appropriate strategies that satisfy Invisibility and other NFRs related to user interaction.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00364-2,,"['Invisibility', 'Non-functional requirement', 'Catalog']",,Springer,,Rainara Maia Carvalho,Rossana Maria de Castro Andrade,Káthia Marçal de Oliveira,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00364-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Detecting coreferent entities in natural language requirements,,"Laboratory for Internet Software Technologies, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China",01-Mar-22,"AbstractRequirements are usually written in natural language and evolve continuously during the process of software development, which involves a large number of stakeholders. Stakeholders with diverse backgrounds and skills might refer to the same real-world entity with different linguistic expressions in the natural-language requirements, resulting in requirement inconsistency. We define this phenomenon as Entity Coreference (EC) in the Requirement Engineering (RE) area. It can lead to misconception about technical terminologies, and harm the readability and long-term maintainability of the requirements.  In this paper, we propose a DEEP context-wise method for entity COREFerence detection, named DeepCoref. First, we truncate corresponding contexts surrounding entities. Then, we construct a deep context-wise neural network for coreference classification. The network consists of one fine-tuning BERT model for context representation, a Word2Vec-based network for entity representation, and a multi-layer perceptron in the end to fuse and make a trade-off between two representations. Finally, we cluster and normalize coreferent entities. We evaluate our method, respectively, on coreference classification and clustering with 1853 industry data on 21 projects. The former evaluation shows that DeepCoref outperforms three baselines with average precision and recall of 96.10% and 96.06%, respectively. The latter evaluation on six metrics shows that DeepCoref can cluster coreferent entities more accurately. We also conduct ablation experiments with three variants to demonstrate the performance enhancement brought by different components of neural network designed for coreference classification.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00374-8,,"['Entity coreference', 'Requirements inconsistency', 'Deep learning', 'Requirement engineering']",1Citation,Springer,,Yawen Wang,Lin Shi,Mingyang Li,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00374-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Theory as a source of software and system requirements,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK",23-May-22,"AbstractToday, when undertaking requirements elicitation, engineers attend to the needs and wants of the user groups considered relevant for the software system. However, answers to some relevant questions (e.g., how to improve adoption of the intended system) cannot always be addressed through direct need and want elicitation. Using an example of energy demand-response systems, this paper demonstrates that use of grounded theory analysis can help address such questions. The theories emerging from such analysis produce a set of additional requirements which cannot be directly elicited from individuals/groups, and would otherwise be missed. Thus, we demonstrate that the theories generated through grounded theory analysis can serve as additional valuable sources of requirements for software and its wider system. This paper extends our previous work by demonstrating how several theories can be constructed and utilised for a single system analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00380-w,available,"['Grounded theory', 'Elicitation method', 'Requirements elicitation', 'Demand-side response', 'Energy service, Energy transition\xa0', 'Case study', 'Systemic concerns, Tacit knowledge']",,Springer,,Ruzanna Chitchyan,Caroline Bird,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00380-w,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Voice of the users: an extended study of software feedback engagement,,"University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",14-Jun-21,"AbstractMany software users give feedback online about the applications they use. This feedback often contains valuable requirements information that can be used to guide the effective maintenance and evolution of a software product. Yet, not all software users give online feedback. If the demographics of a user-base aren’t fairly represented, there is a danger that the needs of less vocal users won’t be considered in development. This work investigates feedback on three prominent online channels: app stores, product forums, and social media. We directly survey software users about their feedback habits, as well as what motivates and dissuades them from providing feedback online. In an initial survey of 1040 software users, we identify statistically significant differences in the demographics of users who give feedback (gender, age, etc.), and key differences in what motivates them to engage with each of the three studied channels. In a second survey of 936 software users, we identify the top reasons users don’t give feedback, including significant differences between demographic groups. We also present a detailed list of user-rated methods to encourage their feedback. This work provides meaningful context for requirements sourced from online feedback, identifying demographic groups who are underrepresented. Findings on what motivates and discourages user feedback give insight into how feedback channels and developers can increase engagement with their user-base.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00357-1,,[],9Citations,Springer,,James Tizard,Tim Rietz,Xuanhui Liu,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00357-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Stakeholder identification for a structured release planning approach in the automotive domain,,"Institute of Software Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany",17-Mar-22,"AbstractIn regulated domains like automotive, release planning is a complex process. This complex process consists of an agreement between product development processes for hardware as well as mechanic systems and approaches for software development. Particularly in automotive, the creation and synchronization of release plans for hardware as well as software is a challenge. Within the whole complex system development, it is challenging to consider the relevant stakeholders in the initial creation of a release plan. Depending on the context that a release plan shall be created for, there are different stakeholders that have to be considered from the beginning. There are numerous publications in the area of release planning, but there is no detailed research that shows which stakeholders have to be addressed in the automotive context. The aim of this work is to identify stakeholders of a release plan as an appropriate approach to create transparency in release planning in the automotive domain. Action research to elaborate relevant stakeholders for release planning was conducted at Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche AG. We present a detailed overview of identified stakeholders as well as their required content and added value regarding two pilot projects. With this contribution, identified stakeholders of release planning from the hardware and software points of view are introduced. We discuss, based on the results, why there are common stakeholders for the two projects and why there are individual stakeholders for each project. With this work, we present a more complete stakeholder identification and a more detailed understanding of their needs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00369-x,available,"['Automotive', 'Release planning', 'Stakeholder identification', 'Required content']",2Citations,Springer,,Kristina Marner,Stefan Wagner,Guenther Ruhe,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00369-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
An impact-driven approach to predict user stories instability,,"Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel",18-Mar-22,"AbstractA common way to describe requirements in Agile software development is through user stories, which are short descriptions of desired functionality. Nevertheless, there are no widely accepted quantitative metrics to evaluate user stories. We propose a novel metric to evaluate user stories called instability, which measures the number of changes made to a user story after it was assigned to a developer to be implemented in the near future. A user story with a high instability score suggests that it was not detailed and coherent enough to be implemented. The instability of a user story can be automatically extracted from industry-standard issue tracking systems such as Jira by performing retrospective analysis over user stories that were fully implemented. We propose a method for creating prediction models that can identify user stories that will have high instability even before they have been assigned to a developer. Our method works by applying a machine learning algorithm on implemented user stories, considering only features that are available before a user story is assigned to a developer. We evaluate our prediction models on several open-source projects and one commercial project and show that they outperform baseline prediction models.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-022-00372-w,,"['User story', 'Requirements', 'Agile software development', 'Machine learning']",4Citations,Springer,,Yarden Levy,Roni Stern,Arnon Sturm,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-022-00372-w,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Empirical research on requirements quality: a systematic mapping study,,"University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",15-Feb-22,"AbstractResearch has repeatedly shown that high-quality requirements are essential for the success of development projects. While the term “quality” is pervasive in the field of requirements engineering and while the body of research on requirements quality is large, there is no meta-study of the field that overviews and compares the concrete quality attributes addressed by the community. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic mapping study of the scientific literature. We retrieved 6905 articles from six academic databases, which we filtered down to 105 relevant primary studies. The primary studies use empirical research to explicitly define, improve, or evaluate requirements quality. We found that empirical research on requirements quality focuses on improvement techniques, with very few primary studies addressing evidence-based definitions and evaluations of quality attributes. Among the 12 quality attributes identified, the most prominent in the field are ambiguity, completeness, consistency, and correctness. We identified 111 sub-types of quality attributes such as “template conformance” for consistency or “passive voice” for ambiguity. Ambiguity has the largest share of these sub-types. The artefacts being studied are mostly referred to in the broadest sense as “requirements”, while little research targets quality attributes in specific types of requirements such as use cases or user stories. Our findings highlight the need to conduct more empirically grounded research defining requirements quality, using more varied research methods, and addressing a more diverse set of requirements types.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00367-z,available,"['Systematic mapping study', 'Secondary study', 'Requirements quality', 'Empirical research']",16Citations,Springer,,Lloyd Montgomery,Davide Fucci,Abir Bouraffa,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00367-z,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

"A multi-level semantic web for hard-to-specify domain concept, Pedestrian, in ML-based software",,"Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, 60115, USA",08-Jan-22,"AbstractMachine Learning (ML) algorithms are widely used in building software-intensive systems, including safety-critical ones. Unlike traditional software components, Machine-Learned Components (MLC)s, software components built using ML algorithms, learn their specifications through generalizing the common features that they find in a limited set of collected examples. While this inductive nature overcomes the limitations of programming hard-to-specify concepts, the same feature becomes problematic for verifying safety in ML-based software systems. One reason is that, due to MLCs data-driven nature, there is often no set of explicitly written and pre-defined specifications, against which the MLC can be verified. In this regard, we propose to partially specify hard-to-specify domain concepts, which MLCs tend to classify, instead of fully relying on their inductive learning ability from arbitrarily-collected datasets. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated approach to construct a multi-level semantic web to partially outline the hard-to-specify, yet crucial, domain concept “pedestrian” in automotive domain. We evaluate the applicability of the generated semantic web in two ways: first, with a reference to the web, we augment a pedestrian dataset for a missing feature, wheelchair, to show training a state-of-the-art ML-based object detector on the augmented dataset improves its accuracy in detecting pedestrians; second, we evaluate the coverage of the generated semantic web based on multiple state-of-the-art pedestrian and human datasets.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00366-0,,"['Requirements specifications', 'Machine learning', 'Machine-learned components', 'Safety-critical systems']",5Citations,Springer,,Hamed Barzamini,Murtuza Shahzad,Hamed Alhoori,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00366-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A systematic literature review of empirical research on quality requirements,,"RISE Research Institutes of Sweden AB, Gothenburg, Sweden",08-Feb-22,"AbstractQuality requirements deal with how well a product should perform the intended functionality, such as start-up time and learnability. Researchers argue they are important and at the same time studies indicate there are deficiencies in practice. Our goal is to review the state of evidence for quality requirements. We want to understand the empirical research on quality requirements topics as well as evaluations of quality requirements solutions. We used a hybrid method for our systematic literature review. We defined a start set based on two literature reviews combined with a keyword-based search from selected publication venues. We snowballed based on the start set. We screened 530 papers and included 84 papers in our review. Case study method is the most common (43), followed by surveys (15) and tests (13). We found no replication studies. The two most commonly studied themes are (1) differentiating characteristics of quality requirements compared to other types of requirements, (2) the importance and prevalence of quality requirements. Quality models, QUPER, and the NFR method are evaluated in several studies, with positive indications. Goal modeling is the only modeling approach evaluated. However, all studies are small scale and long-term costs and impact are not studied. We conclude that more research is needed as empirical research on quality requirements is not increasing at the same rate as software engineering research in general. We see a gap between research and practice.

A use case driven approach to game modeling,,"Department of Information and Computer Science, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia",01-Sep-21,"AbstractWith the increase in market needs, game development teams are facing a high demand of creating new games every year. Although several methodologies and tools were introduced to support the game development life cycle, there is still a lack of evidence that these techniques improve game requirements understandability among development teams. The use of models in requirements engineering is considered a promising approach to support requirements elicitation, negotiation, validation, and management. In the context of game development, game designers argue that models are hard to learn and would restrict their creativity. In this paper, we introduce a novel use case-based game modeling approach that extends the standard UML use case diagram. The proposed technique allows for better representation of game-related requirements and promotes a common understanding of game requirements among game development teams. Our approach is implemented in a tool, called game use case modeling, and its applicability is demonstrated using four well-known games, Super Mario Bros, Tetris, Just Dance, and The Walking Dead. Moreover, in order to assess the perceived understandability, learnability, and usefulness of the proposed approach, we have conducted a survey involving 29 participants from the game development community. Results indicate a very satisfactory agreement regarding the added value of the proposed approach and a willingness of adoption by the game development community.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00362-4,,"['Requirement engineering', 'UML use case diagram', 'Game development', 'Game requirements', 'Game use case modeling']",2Citations,Springer,,Aghyad Albaghajati,Jameleddine Hassine,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00362-4,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Leveraging BPMN particularities to improve traceability links recovery among requirements and BPMN models,,"SVIT Research Group, Universidad San Jorge, Zaragoza, Spain",22-Nov-21,"AbstractTraceability links recovery (TLR) has been a topic of interest for many years. However, TLR approaches are based on the latent semantics of the software artifacts, and are not equipped to deal with software artifacts that lack those inherent semantics, such as BPMN models. The aim of this work is to enhance TLR approaches in BPMN models by incorporating the linguistic particularities of BPMN models into the TLR process. Our approach runs through a threefold contribution: (1) we identify the particularities of BPMN models; (2) we describe how to leverage the particularities; and (3) we build three variants of the best exploratory TLR approach which specifically cater to BPMN models. The approach is evaluated through both an academic case study and a real-world industrial case study. The results show that incorporating the particularities of BPMN into the TLR process leads the specific approach to improve the traceability results obtained by generalist approaches, maintaining precision levels and improving recall. The novel findings of this paper suggest that there is a benefit in researching and taking in account the particularities of the different kinds of models in order to optimize the results of TLR between requirements and models, instead of relying on generalist approaches.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00365-1,,"['Model-driven software engineering', 'Traceability links recovery', 'Requirements engineering']",1Citation,Springer,,Raúl Lapeña,Francisca Pérez,Carlos Cetina,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00365-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

TracIMo: a traceability introduction methodology and its evaluation in an Agile development team,,"University of Dar es Salaam, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania",29-Aug-21,"AbstractSoftware traceability, the ability to relate software development artifacts such as requirements, design models and code to each other, is an important aspect in software development. It yields a number of benefits such as facilitating impact analysis and tracking software changes. However, for companies to reap these benefits, a proper traceability strategy—a plan for how traceability should be managed—needs to be defined and implemented. Existing literature lacks concrete guidelines for practitioners to systematically define such a strategy. In this study, we address this gap by defining a Traceability Introduction Methodology (TracIMo), which is a methodology for systematically designing, implementing and evaluating software traceability in practice. We used design science research to design TracIMo and evaluated it in a case study with an agile development team of a company in the finance domain.

A framework for evaluating and improving requirements specifications based on the developers and testers perspective,,"Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brazil",25-Jun-21,"AbstractRequirements specifications are essential to properly communicate requirements among the software development team members. However, each role in the team has different informational needs in order to perform their activities. Thus, the requirements engineer should provide the necessary information to meet each team member's necessities to reduce errors in software development due to inadequate or insufficient communication. Although some research is concerned with communicating requirements among clients and analysts, no related research has been found to evaluate and improve requirements communication within the software development team. With this in mind, we present the ReComP framework, which assists in the identification of problems in the artifacts used to communicate requirements, identification of informational requirements for each role of the development team, and provide improvement suggestions to address requirements communication problems. ReComP was developed using the Design Science Research (DSR) method and this paper presents the results of two DSR cycles considering the use of ReComP for the developer and tester roles by using, respectively, user stories and use cases as requirements specifications. The results provide evidence that ReComP helps software development teams to identify and improve issues in the requirements specifications used for project communication. In two independent studies, ReComP was able to decrease the frequency of problems by 77% in user stories identified by developers and the frequency of all (100%) problems in use cases identified by testers.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00352-6,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Requirements specification', 'Requirements based on perspectives', 'Requirements communication', 'Design Science Research']",1Citation,Springer,,Ana Carolina Oran,Gleison Santos,Bruno Gadelha,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00352-6,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

A quantitative comparison of the effects of modeling approaches on system verification using a controlled challenge problem,,"George Washington University, Washington, DC, 20052, USA",20-Jun-21,"AbstractTo reduce program risks, engineering methods capitalizing on modeling and machine assistance have been extensively investigated within systems engineering (and more specifically requirements engineering) literature over the past 20 years. However, there are few quantitative comparisons between model-based approaches and legacy document-centric approaches. Studies have shown that the lack of data regarding improvements of modeling has decelerated the adoption of model-based practices. To help address this gap, the authors conducted a screening experiment to compare the effects of modeling on an engineer’s ability to determine if a system has met its originating requirements. First, a notional acquisition program was created based on an unmanned aerial system, including originating requirements as well as both document and model-based design artifacts. Requirements were captured in both a traditional requirements document and a goal oriented requirements engineering model. System implementation data were capturing in both traditional document artifacts and a SysML model. Participants of varying experience levels used randomized combinations of document and model-based approaches to determine whether the notional system met its requirements. The experiment measured the review duration and accuracy, permitting analysis of the effects of model-based approaches for both requirements and system implementation data. The results of the experiment showed that use of a requirements model did not statistically effect the review. A system implementation model was shown to improve novice participants’ reviews, but did not statistically effect experienced participants. The results of this study should inform future research on the use of models, particularly the return on the modeling investment.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00358-0,,"['Model-based systems engineering', 'Requirements engineering', 'Goal oriented requirements engineering', 'SysML', 'Requirements model']",,Springer,,Don Barrett,Thomas Mazzuchi,Shahram Sarkani,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00358-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Network structure and requirements crowdsourcing for OSS projects,,"The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA",17-May-21,"AbstractCrowdsourcing system requirements enables project managers to elicit feedback from a broader range of stakeholders. The advantages of crowdsourcing include a higher volume of requirements reflecting a more comprehensive array of use cases and a more engaged and committed user base. Researchers cite the inability of project teams to effectively manage an increasing volume of system requirements as a possible drawback. This paper analyzes a data set consisting of project management artifacts from 562 open-source software (OSS) projects to determine how OSS project performance varies as the share of crowdsourced requirements increases using six measures of effectiveness: requirement close-out time, requirement response time, average comment activity, the average number of requirements per crowd member, the average retention time for crowd members, and the total volume of requirements. Additionally, the models measure how the impact of increasing the share of crowdsourced requirements changes with stakeholder network structure. The analysis shows that stakeholder network structure impacts OSS performance outcomes and that the effect changes with the share of crowdsourced requirements. OSS projects with more concentrated stakeholder networks perform the best. The results indicate that requirements crowdsourcing faces diminishing marginal returns. OSS projects that crowdsource more than 70% of their requirements benefit more from implementing processes to organize and prioritize existing requirements than from incentivizing the crowd to generate additional requirements. Analysis in the paper also suggests that OSS projects could benefit from employing CrowdRE techniques and assigning dedicated community managers to more effectively channel input from the crowd.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00353-5,,"['CrowdRE', 'Crowdsourcing', 'Collaborative requirements elicitation', 'Stakeholder networks', 'Stakeholder analysis']",5Citations,Springer,,Matthew Robinson,Shahram Sarkani,Thomas Mazzuchi,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00353-5,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Risk-aware business process management using multi-view modeling: method and tool,,"ISITCom, MARS Research Lab, University of Sousse, Route G.P.1, 4011, Hammam Sousse, Tunisia",23-Mar-21,"AbstractRisk-aware Business Process Management (R-BPM) has been addressed in research since more than a decade. However, the integration of the two independent research streams is still ongoing with a lack of research focusing on the conceptual modeling perspective. Such an integration results in an increased meta-model complexity and a higher entry barrier for modelers in creating conceptual models and for addressees of the models in comprehending them. Multi-view modeling can reduce this complexity by providing multiple interdependent viewpoints that, all together, represent a complex system. Each viewpoint only covers those concepts that are necessary to separate the different concerns of stakeholders. However, adopting multi-view modeling discloses a number of challenges particularly related to managing consistency which is threatened by semantic and syntactic overlaps between the viewpoints. Moreover, usability and efficiency of multi-view modeling have never been systematically evaluated. This paper reports on the conceptualization, implementation, and empirical evaluation of e-BPRIM, a multi-view modeling extension of the Business Process-Risk Management-Integrated Method (BPRIM). The findings of our research contribute to theory by showing, that multi-view modeling outperforms diagram-oriented modeling by means of usability and efficiency of modeling, and quality of models. Moreover, the developed modeling tool is openly available, allowing its adoption and use in R-BPM practice.

Formal reasoning for analyzing goal models that evolve over time,,"Smith College, Northampton, MA, USA",10-May-21,"AbstractIn early-phase requirements engineering, modeling stakeholder goals and intentions helps stakeholders understand the problem context and evaluate tradeoffs, by exploring possible “what if” questions. Prior research allows modelers to make evaluation assignments to desired goals and generate possible selections for task and dependency alternatives, but this treats models as static snapshots, where the evaluation of the fulfillment of an intention remains constant once it has been determined. Using these techniques, stakeholders are unable to reason about possible evolutions, leaving questions about project viability unanswered when the fulfillment of goals or availability of components is not guaranteed in the future. In this article, we formalize the Evolving Intentions framework for specifying, modeling, and reasoning about goals that change over time. Using the Tropos language, we specify a set of functions that define how intentions and relationships evolve, and use path-based analysis for asking a variety of “what if” questions about such changes. We illustrate the framework using the Bike Lanes example and prove correctness of the analysis. Finally, we demonstrate scalability and effectiveness, enabling stakeholders to explore model evolution.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00350-8,,"['GORE', 'Tropos', 'Goal evolution']",7Citations,Springer,,Alicia M.

Toward practical adoption of i* framework: an automatic two-level layout approach,,"Beijing University of Technology, PingLeYuan 100, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China",28-Jan-21,"AbstractBridging the gap between academia and industry is an important issue to promote the practicality of i* framework. Researchers have been dealing with this issue from various perspectives, such as simplifying the meta-models or modeling processes of i* framework. In this paper, we exclusively focus on the scalability issue in laying out large-scale i* models and propose a two-level layout approach to automatically lay out i* models in an efficient and comprehensible manner, contributing to the adoption of i* framework in the industry. The proposed approach is designed by considering the semantics of i* constructs and layout conventions of i* models in order to produce meaningful layouts and can appropriately handle both the SD (Strategic Dependency) view and the SR (Strategic Rationale) view of i* models. We have implemented our approach in an open-access prototype tool, which is able to be integrated with existing iStarML-compatible modeling tools. We have conducted a controlled experiment, a case study, and performance testing to empirically and comprehensively evaluate the utility of our approach, the results of which show that our proposal can efficiently produce meaningful layouts that are as comprehensible as manually laid out models in most cases.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00346-4,,"['i* framework', 'Automatic layout', 'Empirical study', 'Prototype tool']",5Citations,Springer,,Yunduo Wang,Tong Li,Qixiang Zhou,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00346-4,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A Game-theoretic approach to analyze interacting actors in GRL goal models,,"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, 31261, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia",09-Apr-21,"AbstractGoal-oriented requirements engineering aims to capture desired goals and strategies of relevant stakeholders during early requirements engineering stages, using goal models. Goal-oriented modeling techniques support the analysis of system requirements (especially non-functional ones) from an operationalization perspective, through the evaluation of alternative design options. However, conflicts and undesirable interactions between requirements produced from goals are inevitable, especially as stakeholders often aim for different objectives. In this paper, we propose an approach based on game theory and the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL) to reconcile interacting stakeholders (captured as GRL actors), leading to reasonable trade-offs. This approach consists in building a payoff bimatrix that considers all actor’s valid GRL strategies, and computing its Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we use two optimization techniques to reduce the size of the payoff bimatrix, hence reducing the computational cost of the Nash equilibrium. The approach goes beyond existing work by supporting nonzero-sum games, multiple alternatives, and inter-actor dependencies. We demonstrate the applicability of our game-theoretic modeling and analysis approach using a running example and two GRL models from the literature, with positive results on feasibility and applicability, including performance results.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00349-1,,"['Conflicts', 'Game theory', 'Goal-oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE)', 'Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL)', 'Nash equilibrium', 'Requirements', 'Undesirable Interactions']",1Citation,Springer,,Jameleddine Hassine,Dhaker Kroumi,Daniel Amyot,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00349-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Is it possible to disregard obsolete requirements? a family of experiments in software effort estimation,,"Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden",12-Apr-21,"AbstractExpert judgement is a common method for software effort estimations in practice today. Estimators are often shown extra obsolete requirements together with the real ones to be implemented. Only one previous study has been conducted on if such practices bias the estimations. We conducted six experiments with both students and practitioners to study, and quantify, the effects of obsolete requirements on software estimation. By conducting a family of six experiments using both students and practitioners as research subjects (\(N=461\)), and by using a Bayesian Data Analysis approach, we investigated different aspects of this effect. We also argue for, and show an example of, how we by using a Bayesian approach can be more confident in our results and enable further studies with small sample sizes. We found that the presence of obsolete requirements triggered an overestimation in effort across all experiments. The effect, however, was smaller in a field setting compared to using students as subjects. Still, the over-estimations triggered by the obsolete requirements were systematically around twice the percentage of the included obsolete ones, but with a large 95% credible interval. The results have implications for both research and practice in that the found systematic error should be accounted for in both studies on software estimation and, maybe more importantly, in estimation practices to avoid over-estimations due to this systematic error. We partly explain this error to be stemming from the cognitive bias of anchoring-and-adjustment, i.e. the obsolete requirements anchored a much larger software. However, further studies are needed in order to accurately predict this effect.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-021-00351-7,available,"['Systematic error', 'Software effort estimation', 'Expert judgement', 'Family of experiments']",2Citations,Springer,,Lucas Gren,Richard Berntsson Svensson,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-021-00351-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A GRL-compliant iStar extension for collaborative cyber-physical systems,,"University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany",04-Feb-21,"AbstractCollaborative cyber-physical systems are capable of forming networks at runtime to achieve goals that are unachievable for individual systems. They do so by connecting to each other and exchanging information that helps them coordinate their behaviors to achieve shared goals. Their highly complex dependencies, however, are difficult to document using traditional goal modeling approaches. To help developers of collaborative cyber-physical systems leverage the advantages of goal modeling approaches, we developed a GRL-compliant extension to the popular iStar goal modeling language that takes the particularities of collaborative cyber-physical systems and their developers’ needs into account. In particular, our extension provides support for explicitly distinguishing between the goals of the individual collaborative cyber-physical systems and the network and for documenting various dependencies not only among the individual collaborative cyber-physical systems but also between the individual systems and the network. We provide abstract syntax, concrete syntax, and well-formedness rules for the extension.

The state-of-practice in requirements elicitation: an extended interview study at 12 companies,,"Software and Service Engineering Group (GESSI), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",23-Jan-21,"AbstractRequirements engineering remains a discipline that is faced with a large number of challenges, including the implementation of a requirements elicitation process in industry. Although several proposals have been suggested by researchers and academics, little is known of the practices that are actually followed in industry. Our objective is to investigate the state-of-practice with respect to requirements elicitation, by closely examining practitioners’ current practices. To this aim, we focus on the techniques that are used in industry, the roles that requirements elicitation involves, and the challenges that the requirements elicitation process is faced with. As method, we conducted an interview-based survey study involving 24 practitioners from 12 different Swedish IT companies, and we recorded the interviews and analyzed these recordings by using quantitative and qualitative methods. Several results emerged from the studies. Group interaction techniques, including meetings and workshops, are the most popular type of elicitation techniques that are employed by the practitioners, except in the case of small projects. Additionally, practitioners tend to use a variety of elicitation techniques in each project. We noted that customers are frequently involved in the elicitation process, except in the case of market-driven organizations. Technical staff (for example, developers and architects) are more frequently involved in the elicitation process compared to the involvement of business or strategic staff. Finally, we identified a number of challenges with respect to stakeholders. These challenges include difficulties in understanding and prioritizing their needs. Further, it was noted that requirements instability (i.e., caused by changing needs or priorities) was a predominant challenge. These observations need to be interpreted in the context of the study. We conclude that the relevant observations regarding the survey participants’ experiences should be of interest to the industry; experiences that should be analyzed in the practitioners’ context. Researchers may find evidence for the use of academic results in practice, thereby inspiring future theoretical work, as well as further empirical studies in the same area.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00345-x,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Requirements elicitation', 'Empirical studies', 'Interviews']",15Citations,Springer,,Cristina Palomares,Xavier Franch,Carme Quer,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00345-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

DAREF: MDA framework for modelling data warehouse requirements and deducing the multidimensional schema,,"LIM Laboratory-Advanced Smart Systems, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Sciences and Techniques of Mohammedia, University Hassan 2, Casablanca, Morocco",21-Sep-20,"AbstractNowadays, the growing importance of modelling in software engineering is without a doubt reinforced by the blossoming of model-driven architecture (MDA). In this trend, MDA could be considered the most convenient approach to integrate the modelling process in data warehousing projects. On the other hand, decision-makers are usually unable to express their business needs in a concise way that allows getting a valid data warehouse (DW), mainly due to the lack of standard methodologies and tools devoted to supporting this situation. This fact might expand the gap between the business world and the IT world and causes troublesome difficulties to interpret and model DW requirements. Moreover, applying MDA for this kind of project requires using new tools to avoid this drawback. In this paper, we provide an MDA framework to design DW requirements and generate afterwards the multidimensional schema. The framework is based on UML profiles and presents to decision-makers a graphical tool for modelling their strategic visions in order to build the system-to-be. Besides, the proposal allows for dealing with data historization and metadata in the generated multidimensional model to perform properly the extract transform load process.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00339-9,,"['Data warehouse requirements', 'MDA', 'Multidimensional schema', 'Historization', 'Metadata', 'UML profile']",4Citations,Springer,,Omar El Beggar,Khadija Letrache,Mohammed Ramdani,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00339-9,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Automatically detecting feature requests from development emails by leveraging semantic sequence mining,,"Laboratory for Internet Software Technologies, Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China",30-Mar-21,"AbstractMailing list is widely used as an important channel for communications between developers and stakeholders. It consists of emails that are posted for various purposes, such as reporting problems, seeking help in usage, managing projects, and discussing new features. Due to the intensive amount of new incoming emails every day, some valuable emails that intend to describe new features may get overlooked by developers. However, identifying these feature requests from development emails is a labor-intensive and challenging task. In this paper, we propose an automated solution to discover feature requests from development emails by leveraging semantic sequence patterns. First, we tag sentences in emails by using 81 fuzzy rules proposed in our previous study. Then we represent the semantic sequence with the contextual information of an email in a 2-g model. After applying sequence pattern mining techniques, we generate 10 semantic sequence patterns from 317 tagged emails that are randomly sampled from the Ubuntu community. We also conduct an empirical evaluation of their capability to discover feature requests from massive emails in Ubuntu and other four open source communities. The results show that our approach can effectively identify feature requests from these emails. Compared to existing baselines, our approach can achieve a better performance in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and positive, with the average precision and recall for discovering feature requests from emails being 76% and 86%, respectively.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00344-y,,"['Requirements discovery', 'Requirements analysis', 'Text mining', 'Feature requests']",2Citations,Springer,,Lin Shi,Celia Chen,Qing Wang,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00344-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
RAPID: a knowledge-based assistant for designing web APIs,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada",03-Feb-21,"AbstractWith the rise in initiatives such as software ecosystems and Internet of Things (IoT), developing web Application Programming Interfaces (web APIs) has become an increasingly common practice. One main concern in developing web APIs is that they expose back-end systems and data toward clients. This exposure threatens critical non-functional requirements, such as the security of back-end systems, the performance of provided services, and the privacy of communications with clients. Although dealing with non-functional requirements during software design has been long studied, there is still no framework to specifically assist software developers in addressing these requirements in web APIs. In this paper, we introduce Rational API Designer (RAPID), an open-source assistant that advises on designing non-functional requirements in the architecture of web APIs. We have equipped RAPID with a broad range of expert knowledge about API design, systematically collected and extracted from the literature. The API design knowledge has been encoded as a set of 156 rules using the Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) multi-valued logic, a formal framework commonly used to describe non-functional and functional requirements of software systems. RAPID uses the encoded knowledge in a stepwise inference procedure to arrive from a given requirement, to a set of design alternatives to a final recommendation for a given API design specification. Seven well-experienced software engineers have blindly evaluated the accuracy of RAPID’s consultations over seven different cases of web API design and on providing design guidelines for thirty design questions. The results of the evaluation show that RAPID’s recommendations meet acceptable standards of the majority of the evaluators 73.3% of the time. Moreover, analysis of the evaluators’ comments suggests that more than one-third of the unacceptable ratings (33.8%) given to RAPID’s answers are due to valid but incomplete design guidelines. We thus expect that the accuracy of the consultations will increase as RAPID’s knowledge of API design is extended and refined.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00342-0,,"['Non-functional requirements', 'Software design and architecture', 'Search-based software engineering', 'Recommendation systems', 'Chatbots', 'Knowledge-based question answering', 'Automated design generation']",2Citations,Springer,,Mahsa H.

This extends best practice requirements engineering principles to meet the demands of this growing niche. The paper follows a case study approach of applying the methodology in the smart water domain, where it achieves positive results. The approach not only heavily utilises iteration alongside domain experts, but also mandates the integration of technical domain experts to ensure software requirements are met.

A retrospective on Telos as a metamodeling language for requirements engineering,,"Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens University Campus, 15784, Ilisia, Athens, Greece",12-Mar-20,"AbstractTelos is a conceptual modeling language intended to capture software knowledge, such as software system requirements, domain knowledge, architectures, design decisions and more. To accomplish this, Telos was designed to be extensible in the sense that the concepts used to capture software knowledge can be defined in the language itself, instead of being built-in. This extensibility is accomplished through powerful metamodeling features, which proved very useful for interrelating heterogeneous models from requirements, model-driven software engineering, data integration, ontology engineering, cultural informatics and education.

Requirements-driven data warehouse design based on enhanced pivot tables,,"INRAE, UR TSCF, Université Clermont, 9 Av. B. Pascal, 63178, Aubiere, France",11-Apr-20,"AbstractThe design of data warehouses (DWs) is based on both their data sources and users’ requirements. The more closely the DW multidimensional schema reflects the stakeholders’ needs, the more effectively they will make use of the DW content for their OLAP analyses. Thus, considerable attention has been given in the literature to DW requirements analysis, including requirements elicitation, specification and validation. Unfortunately, traditional approaches are based on complex formalisms that cannot be used with decision makers who have no previous experience with DWs and OLAP. This forces a sharp separation between elicitation and specification. To cope with this problem, we propose a new requirements analysis process where pivot tables, a well-known representation for multidimensional data often used by decision makers, are enhanced to be used both for elicitation and as a specification formalism. A pivot table is a two-dimensional spreadsheet that supports the analyses of multidimensional data by nesting several dimensions on the x- or y-axis and displaying data on multiple pages. The requirements analysis process we propose is iterative and relies on both unstructured and structured interviews; particular attention is given to enable the design of irregular multidimensional schemata, which are often present in real-world DWs but can hardly be understood by unskilled users. Finally, we validate our proposal using a real case study in the biodiversity domain.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00331-3,,"['Data warehouse', 'Requirements elicitation', 'Pivot tables', 'Multidimensional modeling']",9Citations,Springer,,Sandro Bimonte,Leandro Antonelli,Stefano Rizzi,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00331-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Model elements identification using neural networks: a comprehensive study,,"University of North Texas, 3940 North Elm Street, Denton, TX, 76207, USA",29-May-20,"AbstractModeling of natural language requirements, especially for a large system, can take a significant amount of effort and time. Many automated model-driven approaches partially address this problem. However, the application of state-of-the-art neural network architectures to automated model element identification tasks has not been studied. In this paper, we perform an empirical study on automatic model elements identification for component state transition models from use case documents. We analyzed four different neural network architectures: feed forward neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory, and RNN with gated recurrent unit (GRU), and the trade-offs among them using six use case documents. We analyzed the effect of factors such as types of splitting, types of predictions, types of designs, and types of annotations on performance of neural networks. The results of neural networks on the test and unseen data showed that RNN with GRU is the most effective neural network architecture. However, the factors that result in effective predictions of neural networks are dependent on the type of the model element.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00332-2,,"['Component state transition diagrams', 'Requirements analysis', 'Automated requirements modeling', 'Neural networks', 'Sequence labeling', 'Empirical study']",3Citations,Springer,,Kaushik Madala,Shraddha Piparia,Eduardo Blanco,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00332-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Safety requirements for symbiotic human–robot collaboration systems in smart factories: a pairwise comparison approach to explore requirements dependencies,,"Department of Informatics and Telematics, Harokopio University, Kallithea, Greece",02-Aug-20,"AbstractIndustry 4.0 is expected to deliver significant productivity gain taking advantage of Internet of things (IoT). Smart solutions, enhanced by IoT, are constantly driving revolutionary approaches in multiple domains. Smart factories are one domain where intelligent integrated robotic systems will revolutionize manufacturing, resulting in a complex ecosystem, where humans, robots and machinery are combined. In this setting, human safety requirements are of paramount importance. This paper focuses on symbiotic human–robot collaboration systems (HRC), where human safety requirements are essential. Hence, it aims to explore and prioritize human safety requirement dependencies, as well as their dependencies with other critical requirements of smart factory operation, as effectiveness and performance. Toward this end, the proposed approach is based on SysML to represent the requirements dependencies and pairwise comparisons, a fundamental decision-making method, to quantify the importance of these dependencies. This model-driven approach is used as the primary medium for conveying traceability among human safety requirements as well as traceability from safety requirements to effectiveness and performance requirements in the system model. The analysis is based on the operational requirements identified in the European project HORSE, which aims to develop a methodological/technical framework for easy adaptation of robotic solutions from small-/medium-sized enterprises. Validation of the results is also performed to further elaborate on human safety requirement dependency exploration. The outcomes of this paper may be beneficial for symbiotic HRC systems in the early design stage. As the system is being developed with an emphasis on human safety, all these requirements that have been assessed with highly prioritized dependencies should be taken into account, whereas those with negligible ones have to be ignored since they do not significantly affect the rest of the process. Since operational requirements may be conflicted and incompatible, this approach may be very useful for other systems as well during the system design phase to find the appropriate solution satisfying the majority of the requirements, giving a priority to the ones with highly ranked dependencies and hence facilitating the implementation phase and afterward the production line. The outcomes may be used as a step in developing a model-driven approach which should be able to support the manufacturing process, facilitating the integration of systems and software modeling, which is increasingly important for robotic systems in smart factories incorporating HRC.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00337-x,,"['Symbiotic human–robot collaboration systems', 'Safety', 'Requirement analysis', 'Dependencies', 'SysML', 'Decision making', 'Pairwise comparison']",8Citations,Springer,,Georgia Dede,Persefoni Mitropoulou,Mara Nikolaidou,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00337-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Modeling functional requirements using tacit knowledge: a design science research methodology informed approach,,"University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, UK",21-Mar-20,"AbstractThe research in this paper adds to the discussion linked to the challenge of capturing and modeling tacit knowledge throughout software development projects. The issue emerged when modeling functional requirements during a project for a client. However, using the design science research methodology at a particular point in the project helped to create an artifact, a functional requirements modeling technique, that resolved the issue with tacit knowledge. Accordingly, this paper includes research based upon the stages of the design science research methodology to design and test the artifact in an observable situation, empirically grounding the research undertaken. An integral component of the design science research methodology, the knowledge base, assimilated structuration and semiotic theories so that other researchers can test the validity of the artifact created. First, structuration theory helped to identify how tacit knowledge is communicated and can be understood when modeling functional requirements for new software. Second, structuration theory prescribed the application of semiotics which facilitated the development of the artifact. Additionally, following the stages of the design science research methodology and associated tasks allows the research to be reproduced in other software development contexts. As a positive outcome, using the functional requirements modeling technique created, specifically for obtaining tacit knowledge on the software development project, indicates that using such knowledge increases the likelihood of deploying software successfully.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00330-4,available,"['Functional requirements modeling', 'Tacit knowledge', 'Design science research methodology', 'Structuration', 'Semiotics']",6Citations,Springer,,Adrian Benfell,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00330-4,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Explainability as a non-functional requirement: challenges and recommendations,,"Software Engineering Group, Leibniz University Hannover, Welfengarten 1, 30167, Hannover, Germany",15-Jun-20,"AbstractSoftware systems are becoming increasingly complex. Their ubiquitous presence makes users more dependent on their correctness in many aspects of daily life. As a result, there is a growing need to make software systems and their decisions more comprehensible, with more transparency in software-based decision making. Transparency is therefore becoming increasingly important as a non-functional requirement. However, the abstract quality aspect of transparency needs to be better understood and related to mechanisms that can foster it. The integration of explanations into software has often been discussed as a solution to mitigate system opacity. Yet, an important first step is to understand user requirements in terms of explainable software behavior: Are users really interested in software transparency and are explanations considered an appropriate way to achieve it? We conducted a survey with 107 end users to assess their opinion on the current level of transparency in software systems and what they consider to be the main advantages and disadvantages of embedded explanations. We assess the relationship between explanations and transparency and analyze its potential impact on software quality. As explainability has become an important issue, researchers and professionals have been discussing how to deal with it in practice. While there are differences of opinion on the need for built-in explanations, understanding this concept and its impact on software is a key step for requirements engineering. Based on our research results and on the study of existing literature, we offer recommendations for the elicitation and analysis of explainability and discuss strategies for the practice.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00333-1,available,"['Explainability', 'Software transparency', 'Non-functional requirements', 'Software quality']",75Citations,Springer,,Larissa Chazette,Kurt Schneider,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00333-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
An efficient approach for reviewing security-related aspects in agile requirements specifications of web applications,,"Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",18-Sep-20,"AbstractDefects in requirement specifications can have severe consequences during the software development life cycle. Some of them may result in poor product quality and/or time and budget overrun due to incorrect or missing quality characteristics, such as security. This characteristic requires special attention in web applications because they have become a target for manipulating sensible data. Several concerns make security difficult to deal with. For instance, security requirements are often misunderstood and improperly specified due to lack of security expertise and emphasis on security during early stages of software development. This often leads to unspecified or ill-defined security-related aspects. These concerns become even more challenging in agile contexts, where lightweight documentation is typically produced. To tackle this problem, we designed an approach for reviewing security-related aspects in agile requirements specifications of web applications. Our proposal considers user stories and security specifications as inputs and relates those user stories to security properties via natural language processing. Based on the related security properties, our approach identifies high-level security requirements from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to be verified and generates a reading technique to support reviewers in detecting defects. We evaluate our approach via three experimental trials conducted with 56 novice software engineers, measuring effectiveness, efficiency, usefulness and ease of use. We compare our approach against using: (1) the OWASP high-level security requirements and (2) a perspective-based approach as proposed in contemporary state of the art. The results strengthen our confidence that using our approach has a positive impact (with large effect size) on the performance of inspectors in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00338-w,,"['Agile requirements', 'Requirement verification', 'Software inspection', 'Software security']",8Citations,Springer,,Hugo Villamizar,Marcos Kalinowski,Alessandro Garcia,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00338-w,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Requirements engineering for sustainability: an awareness framework for designing software systems for a better tomorrow,,"La Salle, Ramon Llull University, Barcelona, Spain",14-Aug-20,"AbstractIntegrating novel software systems in our society, economy and environment can have far-reaching effects. As a result, software systems should be designed in such a way as to maintain or improve the sustainability of their intended socio-technical systems. However, a paradigm shift is required to raise awareness of software professionals on the potential sustainability effects of software systems. While Requirements Engineering is considered the key for driving this change, requirements engineers lack the knowledge, experience and methodological support for acting as facilitators for a broader discussion on sustainability effects. This paper presents a question-based framework for raising awareness of the potential effects of software systems on sustainability, as the first step towards enabling the required paradigm shift. An evaluation study of the framework was conducted with four groups of computer science students. The results of the study indicate that the framework is applicable to different types of systems and helps to facilitate discussions about the potential effects that software systems could have on sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00336-y,,"['Sustainability', 'Software', 'Socio-technical systems', 'Requirements engineering', 'Software engineering']",29Citations,Springer,,Leticia Duboc,Birgit Penzenstadler,Jari Porras,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00336-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
SaPeer and ReverseSaPeer: teaching requirements elicitation interviews with role-playing and role reversal,,"ISTI-CNR: Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell’Informazione “A. Faedo”, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche Area della Ricerca di Pisa, Via Giuseppe Moruzzi, 1, 56127, Pisa, PI, Italy",16-Jul-20,"AbstractAmong the variety of the available requirements elicitation techniques, interviews are the most commonly used. Performing effective interviews is challenging, especially for students and novice analysts, since interviews’ success depends largely on soft skills and experience. Despite their diffusion and their challenging nature, when it comes to requirements engineering education and training (REET), limited resources and few well-founded pedagogical approaches are available to allow students to acquire and improve their skills as interviewers. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents two pedagogical approaches, namely SaPeer and ReverseSaPeer. SaPeer uses role-playing, peer review and self-assessment to enable students to experience first-hand the difficulties related to the interviewing process, reflect on their mistakes, and improve their interview skills by practice and analysis. ReverseSaPeer builds on the first approach and includes a role reversal activity in which participants play the role of a customer interviewed by a competent interviewer. We evaluate the effectiveness of SaPeer through a controlled quasi-experiment, which shows that the proposed approach significantly reduces the amount of mistakes made by the participants and that it is perceived as useful and easy by the participants. ReverseSaPeer and the impact of role reversal are analyzed through a thematic analysis of the participant’s reflections. The analysis shows that not only the students perceive the analysis as beneficial, but also that they have emotional involvement in learning. This work contributes to the body of knowledge of REET with two methods, quantitative and qualitative evaluated, respectively. Furthermore, we share the pedagogical material used, to enable other educators to apply and possibly tailor the approach.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00334-0,,"['Requirements elicitation', 'Interviews', 'REET', 'Peer review', 'Role-playing', 'Self-assessment']",17Citations,Springer,,Alessio Ferrari,Paola Spoletini,Muneera Bano,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00334-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Modular norm models: practical representation and analysis of contractual rights and obligations,,"Computer and Information Sciences Department, St. Ambrose University, 518 Locust St., Davenport, IA, 52803, USA",05-Aug-19,"AbstractCompliance analysis requires legal counsel but is generally unavailable in many software projects. Analysis of legal text using logic-based models can help developers understand requirements for the development and use of software-intensive systems throughout its lifecycle. We outline a practical modeling process for norms in legally binding agreements that include contractual rights and obligations. A computational norm model analyzes available rights and required duties based on the satisfiability of situations, a state of affairs, in a given scenario. Our method enables modular norm model extraction, representation, and reasoning. For norm extraction, using the theory of frame semantics, we construct two foundational norm templates for linguistic guidance. These templates correspond to Hohfeld’s concepts of claim-right and its jural correlative, duty. Each template instantiation results in a norm model, encapsulated in a modular unit which we call a super-situation that corresponds to an atomic fragment of law. For hierarchical modularity, super-situations contain a primary norm that participates in relationships with other norm models. Norm compliance values are logically derived from its related situations and propagated to the norm’s containing super-situation, which in turn participates in other super-situations. This modularity allows on-demand incremental modeling and reasoning using simpler model primitives than previous approaches. While we demonstrate the usefulness of our norm models through empirical studies with contractual statements in open source software and privacy domains, its grounding in theories of law and linguistics allows wide applicability.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00323-y,available,"['Frame semantics', 'Hohfeld rights', 'Norms', 'Laws', 'Compliance']",2Citations,Springer,,Sayonnha Mandal,Robin Gandhi,Harvey Siy,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-019-00323-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Cultural influence on requirements engineering activities: a systematic literature review and analysis,,"School of Science, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia",18-Sep-19,"AbstractRequirements engineering (RE) involves the critical activities required to capture customers’ requirements/needs accurately. RE is a communication-intensive activity. As culture plays a major role in the way individuals communicate and perform a task, RE activities might be strongly influenced by individuals’ cultures. However, there are very few published works on this issue. The goal of this study is to explore the influence of national culture on RE activities as reported in existing studies. We carried out a systematic review of literature from five digital databases supplemented with the snowballing technique to retrieve papers which were published between 1990 and 2018. By applying a thematic approach for the identification and analysis of cultural aspects, we identified 16 cultural characteristics that influence RE activities. The identified aspects were mapped into Hofstede’s cultural model. This study increases RE researchers’ and practitioner’s awareness of the influence of national culture on RE activities. The results of this study confirm that, to date, cultural studies in the field of RE are insufficient and more empirical studies are required.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00326-9,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Culture', 'Cultural aspects', 'Cultural influences', 'Systematic literature review']",14Citations,Springer,,Tawfeeq Alsanoosy,Maria Spichkova,James Harland,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-019-00326-9,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A socio-technical-based process for questionnaire development in requirements elicitation via interviews,,"Slippery Rock University, Slippery Rock, PA, 16057, USA",12-Aug-19,"AbstractSoftware development is the process of building systems that solve users’ need and satisfy stakeholders’ objectives. Such needs are determined through requirements elicitation, which is considered an intensive, complex, and multi-disciplinary process. Traditional methods of elicitation often fail to uncover requirements that are critical for successful and wide-scale user adoption because these methods primarily focus on the technical aspects and constraints of the systems rather than considering a socio-technical perspective. The success of information system development involves the identification of the social, organizational and technical features of the systems, which in turn can result in a more acceptable system by users. In this paper, we propose a requirements elicitation process based on socio-technical (ST) systems theory. The process leverages ST system components to help identify a set of ST imbalances, which in turn help in requirements elicitation. The applicability of the process is demonstrated using empirical investigation with a randomized two-group experimental design, where the objective is to see the potential of the proposed process to enhance analysts’ understanding of socio-technical aspects of a domain, interview readiness, and questionnaire quality.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00324-x,,"['Software development', 'Requirement elicitation', 'User interviews', 'Questionnaire development', 'Socio-technical systems', 'Design research']",10Citations,Springer,,Abdullah Wahbeh,Surendra Sarnikar,Omar El-Gayar,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-019-00324-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Expanding the nature and scope of requirements for service systems through Service-Dominant Logic: the case of a telemonitoring service,,"Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa, 55 Ave. Laurier E, Ottawa, ON, K1N 6N5, Canada",02-Aug-19,"AbstractA renewed understanding of service as a process of resource application and integration, rather than as digital or physical products, shifts the focus of service engineering to the value-creating relationships among entities within complex socio-technical service systems. This understanding is based on Service-Dominant Logic (S-D Logic), a recognized perspective on value creation in modern economies. Goal-oriented modeling, in particular when integrating agent-oriented principles, has been shown to be a suitable method for designing and developing service systems based on S-D Logic principles. Yet, the impact of S-D Logic on the nature and scope of requirements to be elicited and analyzed when designing a service system using goal-oriented modeling has not been clearly articulated. We propose a domain-specific profile of the Goal-oriented Requirement Language, a goal-oriented modeling language part of the User Requirements Notation standard, as well as a set of heuristics for eliciting requirements for service systems. Both are derived from a metamodel of service systems based on S-D Logic principles. Using a case study of a telemonitoring service, we demonstrate that using the heuristics to generate a requirements model for the design of the service results in a more complete set of requirements than existing solutions for telemonitoring services. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the impact of S-D Logic on service engineering, pointing toward the need for more research on the impact of operationalized domain theories on requirements engineering.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00322-z,,"['Goal-oriented modeling', 'Service systems', 'Telemonitoring', 'Metamodel', 'User Requirements Notation']",5Citations,Springer,,Lysanne Lessard,Daniel Amyot,Oday Aswad,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-019-00322-z,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Software requirements testing approaches: a systematic literature review,,"Department of Science and Technology, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil",16-Aug-19,"AbstractTesting a software system is an important step approach to ensuring quality, safety, and reliability in safety-critical systems (SCS). Several authors have published new approaches to improve the processes of testing safety requirements taking into consideration existing processes that seek to improve techniques and contribute positively with software developers. This article aims to investigate the main approaches to requirements testing, particularly focusing on safety requirements in the context of SCS. We investigated how these approaches have been developed and what contributions they provide to academia and industry. We evaluated the pros and cons of the approaches and how they related to the joint work of requirements engineers and testers. We performed a systematic literature review (SLR), selecting 53 papers published between 1990 and 2018. Our research was conducted according to the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Biolchini. The results of this SLR point out to the new research related to the software and safety-critical systems testing. The results show issues in the integration of requirements engineers with the application test team and gaps in the approaches found, particularly in the applications of the techniques in the industry setting. Moreover, several approaches are presented to solve problems and help to prevent future problems. The results of this research point to the main approaches to requirements testing and their use in academia and industry, as well as the advantages and disadvantages. The shortcomings allow us to suggest new research in safety-critical systems in the scope of validation, verification, specification, and testing of safety requirements, as well as to integrate test teams with requirements engineers in order to get better results.

Parallel multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm for software requirement optimization,,"Department of Computer Engineering, Babol Branch, Islamic Azad University, Babol, Iran",27-Jan-20,"AbstractIn incremental software development approaches, the product is developed in various releases. In each release, a set of requirements is proposed for the development. Usually, due to lack of funds, lack of time and dependency between requirements, there is no possibility to develop all the required requirements. There are two conflicting objectives for choosing an optimal subset of the requirements: increasing customer satisfaction and reducing development costs. This problem is known as the next release problem (NRP) and is categorized as an NP-hard problem. Unlike the standard version of the NRP, we formulate this problem as a restricted multi-objective optimization problem. There exist metaheuristic algorithms for solving this problem performed as serials. In this paper, we introduce a parallel algorithm based on the master–slave model in order to improve the quality of the solutions. Based on the criteria of multi-objective problems, the quality of the obtained solution is compared with several metaheuristic algorithms. Two scenarios and two different datasets are used for experiments. Results indicate that the proposed method in the first scenario would highly improve the quality of solutions. Moreover, the method reduces execution time significantly through improvement in the quality of the solution in the second scenario.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-020-00328-y,,"['Software requirements', 'Multi-objective algorithm', 'Next release problem', 'Master–slave model']",22Citations,Springer,,Hamidreza Alrezaamiri,Ali Ebrahimnejad,Homayun Motameni,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-020-00328-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

GARUSO: a gamification approach for involving stakeholders outside organizational reach in requirements engineering,,"Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Binzmühlestrasse 14, 8050, Zurich, Switzerland",07-Jun-19,"AbstractStakeholder participation is a key success factor of Requirements Engineering (RE). Typically, the techniques used for identifying and involving stakeholders in RE assume that stakeholders can be identified among the members of the organizations involved when a software system is ordered, developed or maintained—and that these stakeholders can be told or even mandated to contribute. However, these assumptions no longer hold for many of today’s software systems where significant stakeholders (in particular, end-users and people affected by a system) are outside organizational reach: They are neither known nor can they easily be identified in the involved organizations nor can they be told to participate in RE activities. We have developed the GARUSO approach to address this problem. It uses a strategy for identifying stakeholders outside organizational reach and a social media platform that applies gamification for motivating these stakeholders to participate in RE activities. In this article, we describe the GARUSO approach and report on its empirical evaluation. We found that the identification strategy attracted a crowd of stakeholders outside organizational reach to the GARUSO platform and motivated them to participate voluntarily in collaborative RE activities. From our findings, we derived a first set of design principles on how to involve stakeholders outside organizational reach in RE. Our work expands the body of knowledge on crowd RE regarding stakeholders outside organizational reach.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00314-z,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Stakeholder participation', 'Stakeholder motivation', 'Gamification']",27Citations,Springer,,Martina Z.

Engineering digital motivation in businesses: a modelling and analysis framework,,"Leyton UK, London, UK",17-May-19,"AbstractDigital motivation refers to the use of software-based solutions to change, enhance, or maintain people’s attitude and behaviour towards specific tasks, policies, and regulations. Gamification, persuasive technology, and entertainment computing are example strands of such a paradigm. Digital motivation has unique properties which necessitate careful consideration of its analysis design methods. This stems from the strong human factor involvement, and if it is not implemented effectively, it can result in digital motivation being perceived negatively or leading to reduced motivation. The emerging literature on the topic includes approaches for creating digital motivation solutions. However, their primary focus is on specifying its operation, for example, the design of feedback, rewards and levels. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling language which enables capturing digital motivation as an integral part of the organisational and social structure of a business, captured via goal models. We also demonstrate how modelling of motivational techniques at this level, the goal level, enables a more powerful analysis that informs the introduction, design and management of digital motivation. Finally, we evaluate the language and its analysis using different perspectives and quality measures and report the results.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00312-1,available,"['Conceptual modelling', 'Digital motivation', 'Human factors in computing', 'Gamification', 'Requirements engineering']",4Citations,Springer,,Alimohammad Shahri,Mahmood Hosseini,Jacqui Taylor,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-019-00312-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Structural similarity measure between UML class diagrams based on UCG,,"School of Software, Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110819, China",18-Jun-19,"AbstractIn software reuse, the reuse of UML class diagram produced in design phase has received more attention due to the important influence on the following developing process. The reuse is based on similarity. The similarity between class diagrams contains semantic and structural aspects. The existing works focus on semantic similarity, while the structural similarity is little paid attention to. The structure of class diagram can be categorized into two aspects: intra-structure and inter-structure. The intra-structure refers to the composition of each class, and the inter-structure is represented as the relationships between classes. So, the structural similarity measure should be carried out from these two aspects. In this paper, we propose to use a graph named UML class graph (UCG) to represent a class diagram for the structural similarity measure. An algorithm based on UCG Maximum Common Subgraph Sequence is proposed for the inter-structure similarity measure, and UCG edit distance is proposed and introduced to the intra-structure similarity measure. The experimental results show that our proposed approach is effective within a domain or across domains.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00317-w,,"['Software reuse', 'UML class diagram', 'Structural similarity', 'Inter-structure', 'Intra-structure', 'UCG']",9Citations,Springer,,Zhongchen Yuan,Li Yan,Zongmin Ma,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-019-00317-w,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Reducing ambiguity during enterprise design,,"University of Pretoria, Room 3-22, Engineering Building II, Pretoria, South Africa",16-Jul-19,"AbstractRequirements elicitation is one of the most important phases in the design process and applied by many engineering disciplines. A more recent application of the design process is to design the enterprise as an artefact, also called enterprise engineering (EE). Even though there are limits to formal enterprise design due to enterprise complexity, strategic intentions are not realised spontaneously or accidently. Intentional enterprise design is required, starting with the strategic context, eliciting enterprise intentions. Similar to the ad hoc evolution of enterprises, EE as a discipline also developed in a fragmented way with enterprise design knowledge mostly encapsulated in several enterprise design approaches. A previous study analysed eight different enterprise design/alignment approaches, inductively developing a common framework to represent and compare these approaches in terms of four main components. One of the components represents the scope of enterprise design/alignment in terms of three dimensions: design domains, intentions and constraints, and enterprise scope. Since existing approaches use inconsistent means of defining the first dimension, namely the design domains, previous work already provides some guidance on demarcating design domains in a more consistent way. This article focuses on the second dimension, i.e. intentions and constraints, and the need to distinguish between different intention-related concepts to reduce possible ambiguity. The study applies design science research to develop a method for enterprise intentions concept clarification (MEICC) as a theoretical contribution. The study also offers a practical contribution, demonstrating how the MEICC was used to clarify intention-related concepts that feature within a specific approach, namely Hoogervorst’s approach. A coding strategy (including coding conditions, a refined codebook and a coding method), developed for Hoogervorst’s approach via MEICC, is presented as a secondary contribution, since the coding strategy will also be useful to practitioners that use Hoogervorst’s approach.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00320-1,,"['Enterprise engineering', 'Enterprise design', 'Enterprise intentions', 'Enterprise requirements', 'Design domains']",1Citation,Springer,,Marné de Vries,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-019-00320-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Requirements analysis gamification in legacy system replacement projects,,"School of Computing and Communications, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, UK",28-May-19,"AbstractThe replacement of legacy systems in the public sector is fraught with project delays, budgetary overruns, technological and business process complexities. Moreover, the software implemented to replace legacy systems is developed or configured to largely mimic their features and functionality in order to minimize the disruption to organizational operations that accompanies the introduction of new technology. When the requirements for legacy replacement primarily replicate existing applications and processes, opportunities for business process improvement are bypassed. However, it is difficult for practitioners to transcend the business and systems models prevalent in their organizations for many years. The challenge is to support them to overcome such a difficulty, and be creative and engaged during requirements discussions. Our research aims to evaluate the utility of gamifying the requirements activities during legacy replacement projects for scoping replacement systems efforts in a way that takes advantage of opportunities for innovation while minimizing unnecessary changes to the status quo. The supplementation of the requirements process with game elements is explored in our research through the development of a requirements discussion game (RE-PROVO) and its evaluation by practitioners in two government agencies. Our findings reveal that key elements of RE-PROVO, including competition, anonymity and roleplay, encourage a more critical evaluation of business requirements in legacy replacement projects, but that the success of requirements gamification is contingent on a proper incentivization model which takes organizational culture and values into account.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00311-2,available,"['Legacy systems', 'Requirements analysis', 'Gamification', 'Digital government']",12Citations,Springer,,Assia Alexandrova,Lucia Rapanotti,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-019-00311-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Extracting core requirements for software product lines,,"Department of Information Systems, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel",01-Jan-19,"AbstractSoftware Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a promising paradigm for reusing knowledge and artifacts among similar software products. However, SPLE methods and techniques require a high up-front investment and hence are profitable if several similar software products are developed. Thus in practice adoption of SPLE commonly takes a bottom-up approach, in which analyzing the commonality and variability of existing products and transforming them into reusable ones (termed core assets) are needed. These time-consuming and error-prone tasks call for automation. The literature partially deals with solutions for early software development stages, mainly in the form of variability analysis. We aim for further creation of core requirements—reusable requirements that can be adapted for different software products. To this end, we introduce an automated extractive method, named CoreReq, to generate core requirements from product requirements written in a natural language. The approach clusters similar requirements, captures variable parts utilizing natural language processing techniques, and generates core requirements following an ontological variability framework. Focusing on cloning scenarios, we evaluated CoreReq through examples and a controlled experiment. Based on the results, we claim that core requirements generation with CoreReq is feasible and usable for specifying requirements of new similar products in cloning scenarios.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0307-0,,"['Software Product Line Engineering', 'Systematic reuse', 'Requirements specification', 'Variability analysis']",14Citations,Springer,,Iris Reinhartz-Berger,Mark Kemelman,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-018-0307-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A method for analyzing stakeholders’ influence on an open source software ecosystem’s requirements engineering process,,"Lund University, Box 118, SE-221 00, Lund, Sweden",19-Apr-19,"AbstractFor a firm in an open source software (OSS) ecosystem, the requirements engineering (RE) process is rather multifaceted. Apart from its typical RE process, there is a competing process, external to the firm and inherent to the firm’s ecosystem. When trying to impose an agenda in competition with other firms, and aiming to align internal product planning with the ecosystem’s RE process, firms need to consider who and how influential the other stakeholders are, and what their agendas are. The aim of the presented research is to help firms identify and analyze stakeholders in OSS ecosystems, in terms of their influence and interactions, to create awareness of their agendas, their collaborators, and how they invest their resources. To arrive at a solution artifact, we applied a design science research approach where we base artifact design on the literature and earlier work. A stakeholder influence analysis (SIA) method is proposed and demonstrated in terms of applicability and utility through a case study on the Apache Hadoop OSS ecosystem. SIA uses social network constructs to measure the stakeholders’ influence and interactions and considers the special characteristics of OSS RE to help firms structure their stakeholder analysis processes in relation to an OSS ecosystem. SIA adds a strategic aspect to the stakeholder analysis process by addressing the concepts of influence and interactions, which are important to consider while acting in collaborative and meritocratic RE cultures of OSS ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00310-3,available,"['Open source', 'Software ecosystem', 'Requirements engineering', 'Stakeholder analysis']",14Citations,Springer,,Johan Linåker,Björn Regnell,Daniela Damian,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-019-00310-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
From event logs to goals: a systematic literature review of goal-oriented process mining,,"School of EECS, University of Ottawa, 800 King Edward, Ottawa, ON, K1N 6N5, Canada",07-Jan-19,"AbstractProcess mining helps infer valuable insights about business processes using event logs, whereas goal modeling focuses on the representation and analysis of competing goals of stakeholders and systems. Although there are clear benefits in mining the goals of existing processes, goal-oriented approaches that consider logs during model construction are still rare. Process mining techniques, when generalizing large instance-level data into process models, can be considered as a data-driven complement to use case/scenario elicitation. Requirements engineers can exploit process mining techniques to find new system or process requirements in order to align current practices and desired ones. This paper provides a systemic literature review, based on 24 papers rigorously selected from four popular search engines in 2018, to assess the state of goal-oriented process mining. Through two research questions, the review highlights that the use of process mining in association with goals does not yet have a coherent line of research, whereas intention mining (where goal models are mined) shows a meaningful trace of research. Research about performance indicators measuring goals associated with process mining is also sparse. Although the number of publications in process mining and goal modeling is trending up, goal mining and goal-oriented process mining remain modest research areas. Yet, synergetic effects achievable by combining goals and process mining can potentially augment the precision, rationality and interpretability of mined models and eventually improve opportunities to satisfy system stakeholders.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-00308-3,,"['Business process management', 'Event logs', 'Goal mining', 'Goal modeling', 'Intention mining', 'Performance indicators', 'Process mining', 'Requirements engineering', 'Systematic literature review']",31Citations,Springer,,Mahdi Ghasemi,Daniel Amyot,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-018-00308-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
"Collaborative traceability management: a multiple case study from the perspectives of organization, process, and culture",,"Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden",21-Nov-18,"AbstractTraceability is crucial for many activities in software and systems engineering including monitoring the development progress, and proving compliance with standards. In practice, the use and maintenance of trace links are challenging as artifacts undergo constant change, and development takes place in distributed scenarios with multiple collaborating stakeholders. Although traceability management in general has been addressed in previous studies, there is a need for empirical insights into the collaborative aspects of traceability management and how it is situated in existing development contexts. The study reported in this paper aims to close this gap by investigating the relation of collaboration and traceability management, based on an understanding of characteristics of the development effort. In our multiple exploratory case study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 individuals from 15 industrial projects. We explored which challenges arise, how traceability management can support collaboration, how collaboration relates to traceability management approaches, and what characteristics of the development effort influence traceability management and collaboration. We found that practitioners struggle with the following challenges: (1) collaboration across team and tool boundaries, (2) conveying the benefits of traceability, and (3) traceability maintenance. If these challenges are addressed, we found that traceability can facilitate communication and knowledge management in distributed contexts. Moreover, there exist multiple approaches to traceability management with diverse collaboration approaches, i.e., requirements-centered, developer-driven, and mixed approaches. While traceability can be leveraged in software development with both agile and plan-driven paradigms, a certain level of rigor is needed to realize its benefits and overcome challenges. To support practitioners, we provide principles of collaborative traceability management. The main contribution of this paper is empirical evidence of how culture, processes, and organization impact traceability management and collaboration, and principles to support practitioners with collaborative traceability management. We show that collaboration and traceability management have the potential to be mutually beneficial—when investing in one, also the other one is positively affected.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0306-1,available,"['Traceability management', 'Collaboration', 'Software development processes', 'Multiple case study']",22Citations,Springer,,Rebekka Wohlrab,Eric Knauss,Jan-Philipp Steghöfer,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-018-0306-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Known and unknown requirements in healthcare,,"School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancashire, UK",30-Jul-18,"AbstractWe report experience in requirements elicitation of domain knowledge from experts in clinical and cognitive neurosciences.

The paper describes how the elicitation process had to be adapted to deal with problems encountered in terminology and limited consensus among the experts. In spite of the difficulties encountered, a partial causal model of user behavioural pathologies and errors was elicited. This informed requirements for configuring data- and text-mining tools to search for the specific data patterns.

Performance-driven software development: an incremental refinement approach for high-quality requirement engineering,,"Department of Computer Engineering, Abadan Branch, Islamic Azad University, Abadan, Iran",25-Mar-19,"AbstractBy increasing the importance of the performance in industrial and business software systems, efficient approaches to model-based performance engineering are becoming an inherent part of the development life cycle. Performance engineering at abstract levels of the software development process has an important effect on concluding the success of the software by obtaining the knowledge of optimal alternative designs. This paper introduces the performance-driven software development approach and a prediction technique that regards performance quality attributes at the abstract levels of the software development in an incremental refinement manner. The approach provides Z-based specification formalism at the meta-model level in which its instance models are automatically transformed into the formal performance analytical model, called refinable state machine (RSM). This paper analyses the throughput of a RSM by performing an approximation algorithm on two experimental case studies to determine weights of subjective performance characteristics. The approach can use the inherent performance parameters according to product usage and derive an incremental probabilistic policy determination method under design decisions in the performance plan hierarchy. The results exhibit significant support of abstract level performance profiling in terms of the throughput values.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00309-w,,"['Performance modeling', 'Model-driven engineering', 'Incremental refinement', 'Throughput calculation']",5Citations,Springer,,Maryam Nooraei Abadeh,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-019-00309-w,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Improving the identification of functional system requirements when novice analysts create use case diagrams: the benefits of applying conceptual mental models,,"Department of Engineering and Management, Ruppin Academic Center, 40250, Emek Hefer, Israel",14-May-18,"AbstractPlanning an information system (IS) is challenging, especially for inexperienced IS analysts, including students. One area that often causes particular difficulty is defining the requirements of the future system—a phase that is crucial to the success of any IS project. While serving as advisers for students carrying out their first IS projects, we observed that “imagining” the future system’s functionality and workflow from the user’s perspective makes it easier for students to identify the system’s functional requirements. This insight led us to suggest refining the requirements phase by structuring the “imagining” process into a formal Conceptual mental model (CMM)—that is, a tangible visual representation of the user’s beliefs and expectations (i.e., the user’s mental model) about the system to be developed. We expect that this approach, taken from the domains of cognitive psychology and human–computer interaction, will improve the ability of inexperienced IS analysts to identify the functional requirements of the future system, along with their associated relations and actors. In particular, we expect that this approach will yield better Use case diagrams (UCDs)—a key component of the Use case model for representing and then specifying system requirements, relations and actors. Here, we report on a controlled experiment testing whether creation of a CMM prior to the creation of a UCD improves the identification of functional system requirements, relations, and actors in terms of correctness, completeness, and irredundancy of the UCD. We found that participants who produced a UCD after producing a CMM performed significantly better in defining system requirements, relations and actors, as expressed in their UCDs, compared to participants who produced a UCD without first producing a CMM. We conclude that our suggested refinement improves the performance of novice IS analysts in capturing, analyzing and defining functional system requirements, relations and actors in a UCD, in terms of correctness, completeness, and irredundancy.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0296-z,,"['Information systems (IS)', 'System requirements', 'Use case (UC) diagram', 'Human–computer interface (HCI)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Mental model', 'Conceptual mental model', 'Visualization', 'Education']",10Citations,Springer,,D.

A systematic literature mapping of goal and non-goal modelling methods for legal and regulatory compliance,,"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada",17-Apr-18,"AbstractMuch research is ongoing to assess and improve compliance to laws and regulations. As this domain continues to grow and mature, and with more modelling methods introduced to support compliance tasks, important questions need to be asked. What exactly are these methods used for? Where have they been applied? What benefits do they offer? This paper explores how goal-oriented and non-goal-oriented modelling methods have been used for legal and regulatory compliance, and identifies their main claimed benefits and drawbacks based on the kind of compliance tasks they perform. Using a systematic literature mapping approach, we evaluated 103 articles describing the use of modelling methods obtained from a pool of 286 articles. The results indicate that modelling methods focus on the intent of a law, but goal-oriented modelling methods do so while also reflecting the structure of a law, generally with substantial benefits for all compliance tasks. In addition, whereas modelling methods are used for compliance modelling, checking, analysis and enactment tasks, our analysis indicates that the coverage of these methods is more frequent in the healthcare domain with 55% of the articles reviewed targeting it. In terms of the contexts modelling methods address, privacy has the highest level of attention with a focus from 54% of the reviewed articles. The articles reviewed revealed a total of 60 different laws and regulations from 14 different countries, with 62% focusing on privacy. Moreover, while 82% of the articles reviewed addressed concerns of regulated parties, only 12% addressed the concerns of regulators, and 6% addressed concerns of both regulating and regulated parties. This study highlights the benefits and drawbacks of both types of modelling methods and identifies potential benefits and common drawbacks that will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in the selection of modelling methods or in the identification of selection criteria. Finally, the mapping results emphasize the need for more studies outside of healthcare, that are related to contexts other than privacy, that target compliance enactment tasks or that take the concerns of regulators into consideration.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0294-1,,"['Goal-oriented modelling', 'Legal and regulatory compliance', 'Regulators', 'Requirements engineering', 'Systematic literature mapping']",17Citations,Springer,,Okhaide Akhigbe,Daniel Amyot,Gregory Richards,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-018-0294-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Recommending software features for mobile applications based on user interface comparison,,"Institute of Advanced Technology, National Engineering Research Center of Digital Life, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China",20-Jul-18,"AbstractApp features are one of the most important factors that people consider when choosing apps. In order to satisfy users’ needs and attract their eyes, deciding what features should be added in next release becomes very important. Different from traditional requirement elimination, app stores provide a new platform for developers to gather requirements and perform market-wide analysis. Considering that software features provided to users can be found out by exploring existing apps, an important way to elicit requirements is analyzing existing features provided by products which offer related functions and then finding new trends and fashions promptly. In this context, we propose a data-driven approach for recommending software features of mobile applications based on user interface comparison. Our approach mines similar user interfaces (UIs) from publicly available online repository. To calculate UI similarity through the best matches of components of two UIs, text similarity is used to measure the similarity of UI components and genetic algorithm is introduced to improve the comparison efficiency. Then, we develop an algorithm to extract features from similar UIs based on a set of identification rules. These features are further clustered with text similarity algorithm and finally recommended to developers. The approach is empirically validated with 44 features from 10 UIs. The experiment results indicate that our recommended features are valuable for requirement elicitation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0303-4,,"['Feature recommendation', 'Requirements elicitation', 'Mobile apps', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Text similarity']",9Citations,Springer,,Xiangping Chen,Qiwen Zou,Bitian Fan,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-018-0303-4,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Automatic recommendation to omitted steps in use case specification,,"Finotek Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea",07-Feb-18,"AbstractCompleteness is one of the key attributes for a high-quality software requirements specification. Although incomplete requirements frequently occur in the requirements specification, it is rarely discovered. This turns out to be one of the major causes of software project failure. In order to handle this issue, this paper proposes an automatic approach to recommending omitted steps in a use case-based requirements specification. First, we automatically extract diverse scenario patterns by using the verb clustering algorithm and scenario flow graphs. Based on the scenario patterns, our approach detects omitted steps of user’s scenarios by the pattern matching algorithm and automatically recommends appropriate steps for the omitted parts. For validation of our approach, we have developed tool support, named  ScenarioAmigo, and collected 231 use case specifications composing of 1874 scenario steps from 12 academic or proprietary projects. We first carried out the preliminary study to decide appropriate thresholds and weights. Then, we conducted three experiments as a quantitative performance evaluation. First, the cross-validation for the collected scenarios shows the 76% precision and 80% recall. Second, the comparison of recall of  ScenarioAmigo to that of human experts obtained the 20% higher score. As the last experiment, we compared the result of ScenarioAmigo and human experts in terms of severity of each scenario and found that our approach could recommend normal as well as important scenarios, compared to the human experts.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0288-z,,"['Recommendation to omitted steps', 'Use case specification', 'Software requirements completeness', 'Scenario patterns']",5Citations,Springer,,Deokyoon Ko,Suntae Kim,Sooyong Park,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-018-0288-z,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

A requirements engineering methodology for knowledge management solutions: integrating technical and social aspects,,"School of Industrial Engineering and Management, Shenkar, College of Engineering, Design and Art, Ramat Gan, Israel",24-May-18,"AbstractThis paper proposes a unified knowledge management requirements engineering methodology (KM-REM) for tackling the complex nature of knowledge-intensive organizations. Despite the importance of KM for the success of knowledge-intensive organizations, the concept of RE for KM solutions is still vague lacking. Its definitions and guidelines for addressing the different facets of KM during the RE process are yet to be well-defined, encompassing social and technical aspects thereof. Applying the design science research paradigm by using a method engineering methodology, the KM-REM method was developed and implemented in a case study involving a global IT provider firm. This allowed for a comprehensive analysis and requirements specification for a KM solution, which was validated based on expert (managers) evaluation. KM-REM provides comprehensive, practical guidance and tools for KM analysts and RE professionals, for conducting KM-oriented RE, toward enhancing knowledge-intensive business processes with embedded KM solutions. Moreover, KM-REM facilitates tractability in the RE process, by focusing on manageable KM requirements. Thus, the contribution of KM-REM is threefold. First, it extends the research on RE for KM solutions as a specialized area within the RE discipline. Second, it cohesively organizes the RE dimensions and modeling principles for KM, providing customized guidelines and tools.

A framework for designing cloud forensic-enabled services (CFeS),,"Privacy Engineering and Social Informatics Laboratory, Department of Cultural Technology and Communication, University of the Aegean, 81100, University Hill, Mytilene, Greece",13-Mar-18,"Abstract
Cloud computing is used by consumers to access cloud services. Malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities of cloud services to attack consumers. The link between these two assumptions is the cloud service. Although cloud forensics assists in the direction of investigating and solving cloud-based cyber-crimes, in many cases the design and implementation of cloud services fall back. Software designers and engineers should focus their attention on the design and implementation of cloud services that can be investigated in a forensic sound manner. This paper presents a methodology that aims on assisting designers to design cloud forensic-enabled services. The methodology supports the design of cloud services by implementing a number of steps to make the services cloud forensic enabled. It consists of a set of cloud forensic constraints, a modeling language expressed through a conceptual model and a process based on the concepts identified and presented in the model. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is the correlation of cloud services’ characteristics with the cloud investigation while providing software engineers the ability to design and implement cloud forensic-enabled services via the use of a set of predefined forensic-related tasks.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0289-y,,"['Cloud forensics', 'Cloud forensic methodology', 'Cloud forensic process', 'Cloud forensic conceptual model', 'Cloud forensic constraints']",11Citations,Springer,,Stavros Simou,Christos Kalloniatis,Stefanos Gritzalis,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-018-0289-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
The impact of requirements on systems development speed: a multiple-case study in automotive,,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, 412 96, Gothenburg, Sweden",16-Jul-19,"AbstractAutomotive manufacturers have historically adopted rigid requirements engineering processes. This allowed them to meet safety-critical requirements when producing a highly complex and differentiated product out of the integration of thousands of physical and software components. Nowadays, few software-related domains are as rapidly changing as the automotive industry. In particular, the needs of improving development speed are increasingly pushing companies in this domain toward new ways of developing software. In this paper, we investigate how the goal to increase development speed impacts how requirements are managed in the automotive domain. We start from a manager perspective, which we then complement with a more general perspective. We used a qualitative multiple-case study, organized in two steps. In the first step, we had 20 semi-structured interviews, at two automotive manufacturers. Our sampling strategy focuses on manager roles, complemented with technical specialists. In the second step, we validated our results with 12 more interviews, covering nine additional respondents and three recurring from the first step. In addition to validating our qualitative model, the second step of interviews broadens our perspective with technical experts and change managers. Our respondents indicate and rank six aspects of the current requirements engineering approach that impact development speed. These aspects include the negative impact of a requirements style dominated by safety concerns as well as decomposition of requirements over many levels of abstraction. Furthermore, the use of requirements as part of legal contracts with suppliers is seen as hindering fast collaboration. Six additional suggestions for potential improvements include domain-specific tooling, model-based requirements, test automation, and a combination of lightweight upfront requirements engineering preceding development with precise specifications post-development. Out of these 12 aspects, seven can likely be addressed as part of an ongoing agile transformation.

"Semantic hierarchies for extracting, modeling, and connecting compliance requirements in information security control standards",,"Nebraska University Center for Information Assurance, University of Nebraska at Omaha, Omaha, NE, USA",30-Dec-17,"AbstractCompanies and government organizations are increasingly compelled, if not required by law, to ensure that their information systems will comply with various federal and industry regulatory standards, such as the NIST Special Publication on Security Controls for Federal Information Systems (NIST SP-800-53), or the Common Criteria (ISO 15408-2). Such organizations operate business or mission critical systems where a lack of or lapse in security protections translates to serious confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks that, if exploited, could result in information disclosure, loss of money, or, at worst, loss of life. To mitigate these risks and ensure that their information systems meet regulatory standards, organizations must be able to (a) contextualize regulatory documents in a way that extracts the relevant technical implications for their systems, (b) formally represent their systems and demonstrate that they meet the extracted requirements following an accreditation process, and (c) ensure that all third-party systems, which may exist outside of the information system enclave as web or cloud services also implement appropriate security measures consistent with organizational expectations. This paper introduces a step-wise process, based on semantic hierarchies, that systematically extracts relevant security requirements from control standards to build a certification baseline for organizations to use in conjunction with formal methods and service agreements for accreditation. The approach is demonstrated following a case study of all audit-related controls in the SP-800-53, ISO 15408-2, and related documents. Accuracy, applicability, consistency, and efficacy of the approach were evaluated using controlled qualitative and quantitative methods in two separate studies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0287-5,available,"['Security policy', 'Security requirements', 'Requirement extraction', 'Security control standards', 'Regulatory compliance', 'Certification', 'Accreditation', 'Semantic hierarchy']",9Citations,Springer,,Matthew L.

Identifying incompleteness in privacy policy goals using semantic frames,,"Institute for Software Research, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",11-Jun-19,"AbstractCompanies that collect personal information online often maintain privacy policies that are required to accurately reflect their data practices and privacy goals. To be comprehensive and flexible for future practices, policies contain ambiguity that summarizes practices over multiple types of products and business contexts. Ambiguity in data practice descriptions undermines policies as an effective way to communicate system design choices to users and as a reliable regulatory mechanism. In this paper, we report an investigation to identify incompleteness by representing data practice descriptions as semantic frames. The approach is a grounded analysis to discover which semantic roles corresponding to a data action are needed to construct complete data practice descriptions. Our results include 698 data action instances obtained from 949 manually annotated statements across 15 privacy policies and three domains: health, news and shopping. Therein, we identified 2316 instances of 17 types of semantic roles and found that the distribution of semantic roles across the three domains was similar. Incomplete data practice descriptions undermine user comprehension and can affect the user’s perceived privacy risk, which we measure using factorial vignette surveys. We observed that user risk perception decreases when two roles are present in a statement: the condition under which a data action is performed, and the purpose for which the user’s information is used.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00315-y,,"['Semantic frames', 'Semantic roles', 'Privacy risk', 'Natural language processing', 'Privacy']",9Citations,Springer,,Jaspreet Bhatia,Morgan C.

Teaching requirements elicitation interviews: an empirical study of learning from mistakes,,"Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia",16-May-19,"AbstractInterviews are the most widely used elicitation technique in requirements engineering (RE). However, conducting a requirements elicitation interview is challenging. The mistakes made in design or conduct of the interviews can create problems in the later stages of requirements analysis. Empirical evidence about effective pedagogical approaches for training novices on conducting requirements elicitation interviews is scarce. In this paper, we present a novel pedagogical approach for training student analysts in the art of elicitation interviews. Our study is conducted in two parts: first, we perform an observational study of interviews performed by novices, and we present a classification of the most common mistakes made; second, we utilize this list of mistakes and monitor the students’ progress in three set of interviews to discover the individual areas for improvement. We conducted an empirical study involving role-playing and authentic assessment in two semesters on two different cohorts of students. In the first semester, we had 110 students, teamed up in 28 groups, to conduct three interviews with stakeholders. We qualitatively analysed the data to identify and classify the mistakes made from their first interview only. In the second semester, we had 138 students in 34 groups and we monitored and analysed their progress in all three interviews by utilizing the list of mistakes from the first study. First, we identified 34 unique mistakes classified into seven high-level themes, namely question formulation, question omission, interview order, communication skills, analyst behaviour, customer interaction, teamwork and planning. In the second study, we discovered that the students struggled mostly in the areas of question formulation, question omission and interview order and did not manage to improve their skills throughout the three interviews. Our study presents a novel and repeatable pedagogical design, and our findings extend the body of knowledge aimed at RE education and training by providing an empirically grounded categorization of mistakes made by novices. We offer an analysis of the main pain points in which instructors should pay more attention during their design and training.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00313-0,,"['Requirements Engineering Education and Training', 'Requirements elicitation', 'Interviews']",29Citations,Springer,,Muneera Bano,Didar Zowghi,Alessio Ferrari,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-019-00313-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Automating requirements analysis and test case generation,,"GE Global Research, Niskayuna, NY, USA",21-Jun-19,"AbstractWriting clear and unambiguous requirements that are conflict-free and complete is no easy task. Incorrect requirements lead to errors being introduced early in the design process. The longer the gap between error introduction and error discovery, the higher the cost associated with the error. To address the growing cost of system development, we introduce a tool called Analysis of Semantic Specifications and Efficient generation of Requirements-based Tests (ASSERT™) for capturing requirements, backed by a formal requirements analysis engine. ASSERT also automatically generates a complete set of requirements-based test cases. The requirements are captured in a structured natural language that is both human- and machine-readable. Formal analysis of these requirements with an automated theorem prover identifies errors as soon as requirements are written. It also addresses the historical problem that analysis engines are hard to use and understand for someone without formal methods expertise and analysis results are often difficult for the end-user to understand and make actionable. ASSERT’s major contribution is to bring powerful requirements capture and analysis capability to the domain of the end-user. We provide explainable and automated formal analysis, something we found important for a tool’s adoptability in industry. Automating test case generation in ASSERT also provides clear and measurable productivity gains in system development.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-019-00316-x,,"['Requirements formalization', 'Formal analysis of requirements', 'Ontology', 'Automated requirements-based test generation', 'Requirements engineering', 'Formal methods']",9Citations,Springer,,Abha Moitra,Kit Siu,Andrew W.

Providing tool support for specifying safety-critical systems by enforcing syntactic contract conditions,,"Machine Design, Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH), Brinellvägen 83, 100 44, Stockholm, Sweden",30-Dec-17,"AbstractFunctional safety standards such as IEC 61508 and ISO 26262 advocate a particularly stringent requirements engineering where safety requirements must be structured in a hierarchical manner and specified in accordance with the system architecture. In contrast to the stringent requirements engineering in functional safety standards, according to previous studies, requirements engineering in industry is in general of poor quality. Contracts theory has been previously shown to be suitable for supporting such a stringent requirements engineering effort; this support has also been implemented in tools. However, to use these contract-based tools, requirements must be formalized, which is a major challenge in industry. Therefore, to support current industrial requirements engineering practice and the stringent requirements engineering in functional safety standards, it is shown how tool support can be provided even when requirements, and also architectures, are not formalized. This is achieved by enforcing syntactic, yet formal, conditions in contracts theory. Despite the need for further validation, initial findings in an industrial case study indicate high potential in realizing the proposed support in an industrial setting.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0286-6,available,"['Syntactic', 'Contracts', 'Conditions', 'Requirements engineering', 'Specification', 'Structuring', 'Authoring', 'Safety', 'FuSa', 'Architecture', 'IEC 61508', 'ISO 26262', 'Elements', 'Compositional', 'Tool Support']",4Citations,Springer,,Jonas Westman,Mattias Nyberg,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-017-0286-6,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Goal-oriented requirements engineering: an extended systematic mapping study,,"Chalmers and the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",14-Sep-17,"Abstract Over the last two decades, much attention has been paid to the area of goal-oriented requirements engineering (GORE), where goals are used as a useful conceptualization to elicit, model, and analyze requirements, capturing alternatives and conflicts. Goal modeling has been adapted and applied to many sub-topics within requirements engineering (RE) and beyond, such as agent orientation, aspect orientation, business intelligence, model-driven development, and security. Despite extensive efforts in this field, the RE community lacks a recent, general systematic literature review of the area. In this work, we present a systematic mapping study, covering the 246 top-cited GORE-related conference and journal papers, according to Scopus. Our literature map addresses several research questions: we classify the types of papers (e.g., proposals, formalizations, meta-studies), look at the presence of evaluation, the topics covered (e.g., security, agents, scenarios), frameworks used, venues, citations, author networks, and overall publication numbers. For most questions, we evaluate trends over time. Our findings show a proliferation of papers with new ideas and few citations, with a small number of authors and papers dominating citations; however, there is a slight rise in papers which build upon past work (implementations, integrations, and extensions). We see a rise in papers concerning adaptation/variability/evolution and a slight rise in case studies. Overall, interest in GORE has increased.

Addressing the state explosion problem when visualizing off-nominal behaviors in a set of reactive requirements,,"Distek Integration Inc., Cedar Falls, IA, USA",14-Sep-17,"AbstractReactive systems with a large degree of human interaction can be vulnerable to off-nominal behaviors (ONBs) that arise from the human operator’s unpredictability. In prior research, we have addressed the ONB problems by developing an approach to translating a set of reactive requirements into the rule-based causal component model (CCM). The CCM’s analysis involved expanding the CCM rules into a larger set of rules that encompass the system’s entire state space, displaying both nominal and off-nominal behaviors as transition paths. However, a major limitation of CCM is the potential for state explosion, which grows as a function of the system’s component states. In this paper, we introduce the causal scenario model (CSM), which uses the same rule-based approach, while addressing the state explosion problem associated with CCM. The CSM grows as a function of system components and provides a visually concise alternative to CCM, while still providing information useful in the exposing and addressing of ONBs during the requirements analysis phase. We introduce CSM and demonstrate the effectiveness of CSM, using a case study that would be more difficult to visualize using CCM, and most other state-based modeling techniques.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0281-y,,"['Requirements', 'Visualization', 'Modeling', 'Off-nominal behaviors']",,Springer,,Daniel Aceituna,Hyunsook Do,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-017-0281-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Eliciting user requirements for e-collaboration systems: a proposal for a multi-perspective modeling approach,,"Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China",21-Dec-17,"AbstractE-collaboration systems have become a new way of doing business that supports and enables communication, coordination and cooperation between people in shared projects and so on. Yet, eliciting user requirements for e-collaboration systems has proved to be a great challenge, due to the need to capture different knowledge for many different types of stakeholder. This paper proposes an approach for eliciting user requirements for e-collaboration systems. This approach takes a scenario description of e-collaboration systems as input and transforms it into a rich set of four-perspective requirement models, namely Coordination Model, Communication Model, Connection Model, and Collaboration Model. These models, respectively, represent the coordination, communication, connection, and collaboration characteristics of e-collaboration systems. Collectively, these models aim to provide a more complete and accurate requirements specification. An example from a collaborative office system is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.

A set of prescribed activities for enhancing requirements engineering in the development of usable e-Government applications,,"Escuela Politécnica Superior, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Francisco Tomás y Valiente 11, 28049, Madrid, Spain",14-Sep-17,"AbstractOver the last years, e-Government applications have become indispensable in every country as they help stakeholders carry out tasks with the administration. However, and despite their growing usage, most of these applications are created through a developer-centered approach instead of a user-centered one, using traditional development processes that do not fit well with the diversity of stakeholders and existing legislation that involve e-Government applications today. Besides, usability is an important clue in the development of such solutions, so a user-centered approach, combined with a successful stakeholder and legislation analysis, should be considered overall. This paper is focused on addressing these concerns, and it provides a set of prescribed activities, tasks and products to be carried through a user-centered process in order to design usable web-based e-Government solutions. Specifically, our approach considers requirements engineering activities enhancing usability by analyzing the diversity and interests of the stakeholders involved, as well as the specific legislation as a source of organizational requirements. In addition, a validation is provided through a case study, showing the feasibility of the approach presented.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0282-x,,"['e-Government', 'Stakeholder analysis', 'Legislation analysis', 'User-centered development process', 'Requirements engineering', 'Usability']",15Citations,Springer,,Esteban Sánchez,José A.

Understanding what is important in iStar extension proposals: the viewpoint of researchers,,"CIn, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco—UFPE, Av. Jornalista Aníbal Fernandes, s/n - Cidade Universitária (Campus Recife), Recife, PE, 50740-560, Brazil",20-Jul-18,"AbstractiStar is a goal-based requirements modelling language, being used in both industrial and academic projects of different domains. Often the language is extended to incorporate new constructs related to a particular application domain or to adjust it to practical situations during requirements modelling. Currently, the language is undergoing standardisation, and several studies have focused on the analysis of iStar variations to identify similarities and to define a core. This does not imply or constrain the need for iStar to continue to be extended. This paper contributes to the understanding of how iStar is extended by analysing how iStar researchers perform iStar extensions. To address this question, we followed a qualitative approach based on interviews involving 20 researchers from different research groups that proposed iStar extensions. The analysis revealed a good understanding about what extending a modelling language means and pointed out differences about how extensions are proposed. We discovered categories that impact positively on iStar extensions (such as reusing existing extensions, proposing extensions in abstract and concrete syntaxes, and creating new modelling tools), and other categories that impact negatively (such as modifying representations of the original constructs, proposing extensions in an ad hoc fashion and not carefully choosing graphical representations). We also evaluated the findings of interviews through an online survey answered by 30 iStar researchers. Finally, we proposed a set of guidelines to support the proposal for better future iStar extensions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0302-5,,"['Goal-based modelling', 'iStar', 'Extensions', 'Qualitative study', 'Survey']",9Citations,Springer,,Enyo Gonçalves,Marcos Antônio de Oliveira,Ingrid Monteiro,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-018-0302-5,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

RSL-IL4Privacy: a domain-specific language for the rigorous specification of privacy policies,,"INESC-ID, Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal",21-Nov-18,"AbstractMobile and web applications that manage users’ personal information require developers to align their software design with privacy requirements commonly described in privacy policies. These policies are often the sole means to enforce accountability on that data protection. We propose the RSL-IL4Privacy, a domain-specific language for specifying privacy policies that can be simultaneously manipulated by computers and authored and analyzed by humans. In addition, RSL-IL4Privacy can be used as an intermediate language to support model-to-model transformations from and into other related languages. RSL-IL4Privacy provides policy authors with means to define a privacy policy as a set of declarative statements with explicit relationships to services, data recipients, private data types and enforcement mechanisms. The RSL-IL4Privacy is defined with different technologies for supporting distinct levels of formality, namely support for multiple modes of presenting privacy requirements, including tabular, graphical and textual representations, to increase integration with a wider variety of authoring and analyzing practices. We apply this language to support the analysis and comparison of policies from Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Dropbox and IMDb. We discuss with further detail the application of this approach to the Twitter policy by presenting several examples with multiple representations. Finally, we discuss how RSL-IL4Privacy can improve the quality of privacy policies and also identifies threats to validity.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0305-2,,"['Privacy policy', 'Privacy requirement', 'Domain-specific language', 'RSL-IL4Privacy', 'Eddy']",21Citations,Springer,,João Caramujo,Alberto Rodrigues da Silva,Shaghayegh Monfared,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-018-0305-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
An empirical study on the use of i* by non-technical stakeholders: the case of strategic dependency diagrams,,"School of Systems and Telematics, Universidad del Azuay, Av. 24 de Mayo 7-77 y Hernán Malo, Cuenca, Azuay, Ecuador",13-Jun-18,"AbstractEarly phases of information systems engineering include the understanding of the enterprise’s context and the construction of models at different levels of decomposition, required to design the system architecture. These time-consuming activities are usually conducted by relatively large teams, composed of groups of non-technical stakeholders playing mostly an informative role (i.e. not involved in documentation and even less in modelling), led by few experienced technical consultants performing most of the documenting and modelling effort. This paper evaluates the ability of non-technical stakeholders to create strategic dependency diagrams written with the i* language in the design of the context model of a system architecture, and find out which difficulties they may encounter and what the quality of the models they build is. A case study involving non-technical stakeholders from 11 organizational areas in an Ecuadorian university held under the supervision and coordination of the two authors acting as consultants. The non-technical stakeholders identified the majority of the dependencies that should appear in the case study’s context model, although they experienced some difficulties in declaring the type of dependency, representing such dependencies graphically and applying the description guidelines provided in the training. Managers were observed to make more mistakes than other more operational roles. From the observations of these results, a set of methodological advices were compiled for their use in future, similar endeavours. It is concluded that non-technical stakeholders can take an active role in the construction of the context model.

Whereas requirements engineering for transactional systems aims to discover the functionality of the system-to-be, data warehouse requirements engineering aims to discover the Information contents of the data-warehouse-to-be. Though notions of goals, Decisions, business processes, business events have been used to set the context for Information discovery, the move from these to obtain the relevant Information is largely ad hoc, unguided, and does not provide traceability of Information. We propose four elicitation techniques that are inferred from manager concerns during Decision making and that provide guidance and traceability. These form a suite such that each augments the set of already discovered Information. Consequently, the possibility of missing requirements is reduced, thereby making for more effective requirements engineering.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0283-9,,"['Information', 'Decision', 'Decision–Information', 'CSFI', 'ENDSI', 'MEANSI', 'Outcome feedback']",10Citations,Springer,,Deepika Prakash,Naveen Prakash,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-017-0283-9,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Value-based requirements engineering: method and experience,,"Greater Manchester Academic Health Sciences Network, Manchester, UK",06-Jun-17,"Abstract‘Socio-political’ issues, such as emotions, values and people’s feelings, are often cited as problems in the RE process. A method is described for analysing such issues. The method consists of a taxonomy of stakeholders’ values, motivations and emotions (VME), with process guidance for eliciting and analysing these issues for the RE process and design implications. Values are personal attitudes or long-term beliefs which may influence stakeholder functional and non-functional requirements. Motivations are psychological constructs related to personality traits which may be viewed as stakeholders’ long-term goals in RE. Emotions are cues to stakeholders’ reactions arising from value/motivation conflicts. The method is supported by a website which illustrates the taxonomy with explanations and scenarios describing problems arising from value conflicts, and from poor understanding of stakeholder values. Two method validation studies were undertaken: first, an evaluation of the website and method by novices and RE experts; and second, case study applications of RE value analysis in real-world industrial practice. The method was used by all practitioners, although in different ways, some used it to create an agenda of issues for analysis while others employed the VMEs to interpret stakeholders’ views and manage stakeholder negotiations. The validation studies provide evidence for the acceptability of the method for industrial practitioners, illustrating how value-related problems are identified and analysed effectively by the method.

A method of requirements change analysis,,"Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, 3083, Australia",14-Jul-17,"AbstractSoftware requirements are often not set in concrete at the start of a software development project; and requirement changes become necessary and sometimes inevitable due to changes in customer requirements and changes in business rules and operating environment; hence, requirements development, which includes requirements changes, is a part of a software process. Previous research reports that correcting requirements errors late costs many times more than correcting them during the requirements development phase. There is, hence, a need to manage them well and to analyse them in order to identify the impacts, difficulties and potential conflicts with existing requirements. Most studies on requirements change analysis are done at the source code level while paying less attention to the initiation of changes at a higher level. In this paper, we present a method of requirements change analysis based on the changes themselves which are initiated at higher levels.

Mending the patchwork of requirements from multiple standards using participative goal modelling: a case in the food industry,,"CTCV, Technological Center, Coimbra, Portugal",18-Apr-17,"AbstractAn increasing number of concurrent standards and regulations is being imposed on organizations operating in various domains. From healthcare to automotive to food, demands from national legislation, directives of each target market, and edicts from specific clients are creating a patchwork of requirements for compliance and audit. Managing these disconnected frameworks involves considerable overhead, duplications, and conflicts. But integrating and harmonizing these requirements needs the collaboration of varied stakeholders, with different trainings and backgrounds, capable of translating the impacts of the various norms in the different sectors of the organization. We propose a participative goal-oriented approach, consisting of four steps, to assist in this process. It brings together the requirements from the various regulations, the organizational goals, and measurement indicators. We describe its use in a company operating in the food industry, one of the most regulated in the world, where audits are very frequent, to integrate ISO 22000, IFS Food, and BRC Global Standards. Our findings show that an effective integration of the multiple regulations was possible and that the resulting goal diagrams are an effective tool for communicating with various stakeholders, such as employees, clients, auditors, consultants, and representatives of industry initiatives.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0268-8,,"['Participative goal modelling', 'GRL', 'Multi-standard integration', 'Food safety standards', 'Audits', 'Regulatory compliance']",3Citations,Springer,,João Barata,Paulo Rupino da Cunha,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-017-0268-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
"Improving the representation of roles in conceptual modeling: theory, method, and evidence",,"John Cook School of Business, Saint Louis University, Saint Louis, MO, 63108, USA",21-Jun-17,"AbstractConceptual models represent the Organizational domain for which an information system is developed. These models are important tools in defining the requirements for the system. When describing an Organization or part of it, a key concept is the notion of roles played by actors in the domain. Actors in an Organization act in various roles, hence, showing that roles in a conceptual model can promote understanding of how the Organization works. However, despite the importance of roles in understanding Organizations and their prevalence in various aspects of information systems development, no consensus exists on what roles are, or how to represent them in conceptual models. In this paper, we formally define role as a conceptual modeling construct based on literature analysis, ontological concepts, and principles of classification. Using this definition, we derive guidelines for representing roles in conceptual models and suggest rules for modeling roles with the widely used extended entity-relationship grammar. Finally, we test the effectiveness of the modeling rules by conducting an experimental study to compare the domain understanding of readers using two types of conceptual modeling scripts.

Goal model analysis of autonomy requirements for Unmanned Aircraft Systems,,"Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD, 20723, USA",18-Jul-17,"AbstractDesigning Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) for optimal autonomy while meeting user requirements is quite challenging. Researchers have focused on improving autonomy algorithms and verification methods to ensure safe and reliable autonomous behavior in UASs, but little research has been conducted on requirements engineering for UASs to answer design questions and explore the trade space for using autonomy to satisfy user requirements. This paper introduces a method to determine an optimal set of autonomous capabilities that satisfies UAS user requirements in the early stages of conceptual design. The method uses a modified Autonomy Requirements Engineering (ARE) process that applies quantitative measures and statistical analysis to Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE). We demonstrate this method in a case study of a “disaster robot,” i.e., a hazard response UAS for which the autonomy requirements were optimized using a goal model developed in the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL), as implemented in the modeling tool jUCMNav. The high-level goals of the hazard response UAS—system performance, cost, and safety—were evaluated using the formula-based GRL strategy evaluation algorithm resident in jUCMNav version 6.0. An autonomy trade space study was conducted through a Design and Analysis of Simulation Experiments (DASE). Our designed simulation experiment inserted the number of trials (evaluation strategies) and inputs into the goal model, and evaluation data were analyzed to optimize design factors based on user weightings of the response variables. This paper presents a structured method of ARE for UASs, which could be adopted more broadly across other domains, demonstrating how to optimize autonomous capabilities for different design conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0278-6,,"['Autonomy', 'Autonomy Requirements Engineering (ARE)', 'Goal modeling', 'Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL)', 'Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs)', 'Design and Analysis of Simulation Experiments (DASE)']",13Citations,Springer,,Kerry Neace,Robert Roncace,Pavel Fomin,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-017-0278-6,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Using the AMAN-DA method to generate security requirements: a case study in the maritime domain,,"CRI, Université Panthéon Sorbonne, Paris, France",22-Sep-17,"AbstractSecurity requirements are known to be “the most difficult of requirements types” and potentially the ones causing the greatest risk if they are not correct. One approach to requirements elicitation is based on the reuse of explicit knowledge. AMAN-DA is a requirement elicitation method that reuses encapsulated knowledge in security and domain ontologies to produce security requirements specifications. The main research question addressed in this paper is to what extent is AMAN-DA able to generate domain-specific security requirements? Following a well-documented process, a case study related to the maritime domain was undertaken with the goal to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of AMAN-DA for the elicitation and analysis of domain-specific security requirements. The usefulness of the method was also evaluated with a group of 12 experts. The paper demonstrates the elicitation of domain-specific security requirements by presenting the AMAN-DA method and its application. It describes the evaluation and reports some significant results and their implications for practice and future research, especially for the field of knowledge reuse in requirements engineering.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0279-5,,"['Security', 'Requirements engineering', 'Domain', 'Ontologies', 'Case study']",9Citations,Springer,,Amina Souag,Raúl Mazo,Camille Salinesi,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-017-0279-5,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Discovering undocumented knowledge through visualization of agile software development activities,,"Software Innovation Center, NTT Corporation, Tokyo, Japan",04-Apr-18,"AbstractIn agile software development projects, software engineers prioritize implementation over documentation. Is the cost of missing documentation greater than the cost of producing unnecessary or unused documentation? Agile software engineers must still maintain other software artifacts, such as tickets in an issue tracking system or source code committed to a version control system (VCS). Do these artifacts contain useful knowledge? In this paper, we examine undocumented knowledge in a multi-case exploratory case study of industrial agile software development projects. The first is an internal project with 159 source code commits and roughly 8000 lines of code. The second is an external project with 760 source code commits and roughly 50,000 lines of code. We introduce a ticket-commit network chart (TCC) that visually represents time-series commit activities along with filed issue tickets. We also implement a tool to generate the TCC using both commit log and ticket data. Our case study revealed that software engineers committed source code to the VCS without a corresponding issue ticket in a non-trivial minority of instances. If these commits were based on and linked to individual issue tickets, then these “unissued” tickets would have accounted for a non-trivial minority (5–21%) of the knowledge needed for future software modification and operations. End users and requirements engineers also evaluated the contents of these commits. They found that the omission of links to individual tickets had an important impact on future software modification or operation with between 22 and 49% of these instances resulting in undocumented knowledge.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0291-4,,"['Agile', 'Agile development', 'Agile requirements', 'Requirements management', 'Requirements knowledge']",7Citations,Springer,,Shinobu Saito,Yukako Iimura,Aaron K.

Customer support ticket escalation prediction using feature engineering,,"University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada",06-Apr-18,"Abstract Understanding and keeping the customer happy is a central tenet of requirements engineering. Strategies to gather, analyze, and negotiate requirements are complemented by efforts to manage customer input after products have been deployed. For the latter, support tickets are key in allowing customers to submit their issues, bug reports, and feature requests. If insufficient attention is given to support issues, however, their escalation to management becomes time-consuming and expensive, especially for large organizations managing hundreds of customers and thousands of support tickets. Our work provides a step toward simplifying the job of support analysts and managers, particularly in predicting the risk of escalating support tickets. In a field study at our large industrial partner, IBM, we used a design science research methodology to characterize the support process and data available to IBM analysts in managing escalations. In a design science methodology, we used feature engineering to translate our understanding of support analysts’ expert knowledge of their customers into features of a support ticket model. We then implemented these features into a machine learning model to predict support ticket escalations. We trained and evaluated our machine learning model on over 2.5 million support tickets and 10,000 escalations, obtaining a recall of 87.36% and an 88.23% reduction in the workload for support analysts looking to identify support tickets at risk of escalation. Further on-site evaluations, through a prototype tool we developed to implement our machine learning techniques in practice, showed more efficient weekly support ticket management meetings. Finally, in addition to these research evaluation activities, we compared the performance of our support ticket model with that of a model developed with no feature engineering; the support ticket model features outperformed the non-engineered model. The artifacts created in this research are designed to serve as a starting place for organizations interested in predicting support ticket escalations, and for future researchers to build on to advance research in escalation prediction.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0292-3,,"['Customer relationship management', 'Machine learning', 'Escalation prediction', 'Customer support ticket', 'Design science research']",4Citations,Springer,,Lloyd Montgomery,Daniela Damian,Tyson Bulmer,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-018-0292-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Improving the identification of hedonic quality in user requirements: a second controlled experiment,,"Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Gottlieb-Daimler-Strasse 42, Building 47, 67663, Kaiserslautern, Germany",12-May-18,"AbstractSystematically engineering a good user experience (UX) into a computer-based system under development demands that the user requirements of the system reflect all needs, including emotional, of all stakeholders. User requirements address two different types of qualities: pragmatic qualities (PQs), that address system functionality and usability, and hedonic qualities (HQs) that address the stakeholder’s psychological well-being. Studies show that users tend to describe such satisfying UXes mainly with PQs and that some users seem to believe that they are describing an HQ when they are actually describing a PQ. The problem is to see if classification of any user requirement as PQ-related or HQ-related is difficult, and if so, why. We conducted two controlled experiments involving the same twelve requirements-engineering and UX professionals, hereinafter called “analysts.” The first experiment, which had the twelve analysts classifying each of 105 user requirements as PQ-related or HQ-related, shows that neither (1) an analyst’s involvement in the project from which the requirements came nor (2) the analyst’s use of a detailed model of the qualities in addition to the standard definitions of “PQ” and “HQ” has a positive effect on the consistency of the analyst’s classification with that of others. The second experiment, which had the twelve analysts classifying each of a set of 50 user requirements, derived from the 105 of the first experiment, showed that difficulties seem to be caused both by the analyst’s lacking skill in applying the definitions of “PQ” and “HQ” and by poorly written user requirement specifications. The first experiment revealed that classification of user requirements is a lot harder than initially assumed. The second experiment provided evidence that the difficulties can be mitigated by the combination of (1) training analysts in applying the definitions of “PQ” and “HQ” and (2) casting user requirement specifications in a new template that forces provision of the information needed for reliable classification. The experiment shows also that neither training analysts nor casting user requirement specifications in the new template, by itself, mitigates the difficulty in classifying user requirements.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0290-5,,"['Hedonic quality', 'Pragmatic quality', 'Controlled experiment', 'User experience', 'Project involvement', 'Definitions of pragmatic and hedonic qualities', 'Quality model', 'Classifier training', 'User story template']",5Citations,Springer,,Andreas Maier,Daniel M.

On user rationale in software engineering,,"University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",06-Apr-18,"AbstractRationale refers to the reasoning and justification behind human decisions, opinions, and beliefs. In software engineering, rationale management focuses on capturing design and requirements decisions and on organizing and reusing project knowledge. This paper takes a different view on rationale written by users in online reviews. We studied 32,414 reviews for 52 software applications in the Amazon Store. Through a grounded theory approach and peer content analysis, we investigated how users argue and justify their decisions, e.g., about upgrading, installing, or switching software applications. We also studied the occurrence frequency of rationale concepts such as issues encountered or alternatives considered in the reviews and found that assessment criteria like performance, compatibility, and usability represent the most pervasive concept. We identified a moderate positive correlation between issues and criteria and furthermore assessed the distribution of rationale concepts with respect to rating and verbosity. We found that issues tend to appear more in lower star rated reviews, while criteria, alternatives, and justifications seem to appear more in three star rated reviews. Also, reviews reporting alternatives seem to be more verbose than reviews reporting criteria. A follow-up qualitative study of sub-concepts revealed, that users also report other alternatives (e.g., alternative software provider), criteria (e.g., cost), and decisions (e.g., on rating software). We then used the truth set of manually labeled review sentences to explore how accurately we can mine rationale concepts from the reviews. We evaluated the classification algorithms Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian Process, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron Classifier using a baseline and random configuration. Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, trained on the review metadata, syntax tree of the review text, and influential terms, achieved a precision around 80% for predicting sentences with alternatives and decisions, with top recall values of 98%. On the review level, precision was up to 13% higher with recall values reaching 99%. Using only word features, we achieved in most cases the highest precision and highest recall respectively using the Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithm. We discuss the findings and the rationale importance for supporting deliberation in user communities and synthesizing the reviews for developers.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0293-2,,"['App analytics', 'Rationale', 'Review mining']",40Citations,Springer,,Zijad Kurtanović,Walid Maalej,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-018-0293-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Hazard Relation Diagrams: a diagrammatic representation to increase validation objectivity of requirements-based hazard mitigations,,"Department of Computer Science, State University of New York at Oswego, 7060 State Route 104, Oswego, NY, 13126, USA",05-May-17,"AbstractWhen developing safety-critical embedded systems, it is necessary to ensure that the system under development poses no harm to human users or external systems during operation. To achieve this, potential hazards are identified and potential mitigations for those hazards are documented in requirements. During requirements validation, the stakeholders assess if the documented hazard-mitigating requirements can avoid the identified hazards. Requirements validation is highly subjective. Among others, validation depends on the stakeholders’ understanding of the involved processes, their familiarity with the system under development, and the information available. In consequence, there is the risk that stakeholders judge the adequacy of hazard-mitigating requirements based on their individual opinions about the hazards, rather than on the documented information about the system’s hazards. To improve the validation of hazard-mitigating requirements, we recently proposed a diagrammatic representation called Hazard Relation Diagrams (Tenbergen B, Weyer T, Pohl K, Supporting the validation of adequacy in requirements-based hazard mitigations. In: Requirements engineering: foundation for software quality. LNCS, vol 9013. Springer, pp 17–32, 2015). In this paper, we extend the ontology of Hazard Relation Diagrams, present their notations, and define well-formedness rules. We elaborate on the application of Hazard Relation Diagrams to visualize complex relationships between hazards and mitigations and present an automated approach to generate Hazard Relation Diagrams. Finally, we report on our empirical evaluations about the impact of Hazard Relation Diagrams on review objectivity, effectiveness, efficiency, and reviewer’s subjective confidence.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0267-9,,"['Safety requirements', 'Hazards', 'Hazard-mitigating requirements', 'Safety assessment', 'Validation', 'Reviews', 'Inspections', 'Mitigation', 'Adequacy', 'Modeling', 'Safety-critical embedded systems', 'Model-based engineering', 'Hazard Relation Diagrams']",10Citations,Springer,,Bastian Tenbergen,Thorsten Weyer,Klaus Pohl,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-017-0267-9,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Direct and mediating influences of user-developer perception gaps in requirements understanding on user participation,,"School of Software, Beihang University, No. 37 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing, 100191, China",13-Apr-17,"AbstractUser participation is considered an effective way to conduct requirements engineering, but user-developer perception gaps in requirements understanding occur frequently. Since user participation in practice is not as active as we expect and the requirements perception gap has been recognized as a risk that negatively affects projects, exploring whether user-developer perception gaps in requirements understanding will hinder user participation is worthwhile. This will help develop a greater comprehension of the intertwined relationship between user participation and perception gap, a topic that has not yet been extensively examined. This study investigates the direct and mediating influences of user-developer requirements perception gaps on user participation by integrating requirements uncertainty and top management support. Survey data collected from 140 subjects were examined and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that perception gaps have a direct negative effect on user participation and negate completely the positive effect of top management support on user participation. Additionally, perception gaps do not have a mediating effect between requirements uncertainty and user participation because requirements uncertainty does not significantly and directly affect user participation, but requirements uncertainty indirectly influences user participation due to its significant direct effect on perception gaps. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed, and limitations and possible future research areas are identified.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0266-x,,"['Perception gap', 'User participation', 'Requirements uncertainty', 'Top management support', 'Requirements engineering']",4Citations,Springer,,Jingdong Jia,Luiz Fernando Capretz,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-017-0266-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Multi-objective reasoning with constrained goal models,,"University of Trento, Trento, Italy",24-Dec-16,"AbstractGoal models have been widely used in computer science to represent software requirements, business objectives, and design qualities. Existing goal modelling techniques, however, have shown limitations of expressiveness and/or tractability in coping with complex real-world problems. In this work, we exploit advances in automated reasoning technologies, notably satisfiability and optimization modulo theories (SMT/OMT), and we propose and formalize: (1) an extended modelling language for goals, namely the constrained goal model (CGM), which makes explicit the notion of goal refinement and of domain assumption, allows for expressing preferences between goals and refinements and allows for associating numerical attributes to goals and refinements for defining constraints and optimization goals over multiple objective functions, refinements, and their numerical attributes; (2) a novel set of automated reasoning functionalities over CGMs, allowing for automatically generating suitable refinements of input CGMs, under user-specified assumptions and constraints, that also maximize preferences and optimize given objective functions. We have implemented these modelling and reasoning functionalities in a tool, named CGM-Tool, using the OMT solver OptiMathSAT as automated reasoning backend. Moreover, we have conducted an experimental evaluation on large CGMs to support the claim that our proposal scales well for goal models with 1000s of elements.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0263-5,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Goal models', 'SAT/SMT/OMT']",34Citations,Springer,,Chi Mai Nguyen,Roberto Sebastiani,Paolo Giorgini,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0263-5,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Four reference models for transparency requirements in information systems,,"Bournemouth University, Poole, UK",10-Mar-17,"AbstractTransparency is a key emerging requirement in modern businesses and their information systems. Transparency refers to the information which flows amongst stakeholders for the purpose of informed decision-making and taking the right action. Transparency is generally associated with positive connotations such as trust and accountability. However, it has been shown that it could have adverse effects such as information overload and affecting decisions objectiveness. This calls for systematic approaches for transparency to ensure its cost-effectiveness and avoid such adverse side effects. This is especially true considering that the relatively few works in the literature on transparency requirements have focused mainly on making information available and accessible and have paid little focus on the information receivers’ side and making it meaningful for them. In this paper, we reflect on our previous research on transparency and its multi-faceted constructs and review multi-disciplinary conceptualisation and propose four reference models which are meant to form a holistic conceptual baseline for transparency requirements in information systems. These reference models cover transparency actors, transparency meaningfulness, transparency usefulness, and information quality in transparency. We also discuss the interdependencies amongst these four reference models and their implications for requirements engineers and information system analysts. As a proof of concept, we analyse a mainstream transparency document, the United Kingdom Freedom of Information Act, in the light of our reference models and demonstrate the need to consider transparency more holistically and the need to include the information receiver’s perspective and the inter-relations amongst various properties and constituents of transparency as well. We then highlight areas of improvement informed by our analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0265-y,available,"['Transparency requirements', 'Transparency stakeholders', 'Meaningful transparency', 'Useful transparency', 'Information quality', 'Transparency management', 'Information systems']",40Citations,Springer,,Mahmood Hosseini,Alimohammad Shahri,Keith Phalp,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-017-0265-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
An approach for requirements prioritization based on tensor decomposition,,"Department of Computer Engineering, Sari Branch, Islamic Azad University, Sari, Iran",07-Dec-16,"AbstractA potential mathematical framework for machine learning is multi-linear algebra of the higher-order tensor that can reveal the relationships among multiple factors underlying the observations. Prioritizing the requirements of a project facilitates the process of requirements engineering and involves multifactors. Due to existing time constraints and budget related to projects, by prioritizing the requirements in an appropriate order we can select and apply them more accurately and this causes to increase the quality of software and customers’ satisfaction. In order to prioritize the requirements, there are many approaches that consider different parameters and different view point in their prioritization process. But as far as we know none of them considers the simultaneous effect among entities, namely functional requirements, non-functional requirements and stakeholders in their prioritization process. In this paper, we decided to consider the simultaneous effect among functional, non-functional requirements and stakeholders that have different preferences on requirements by modeling a three-order tensor. Then by applying multi-way analysis, we will obtain appropriate ordered lists of requirements. To evaluate our approach, a controlled experiment has been provided that compares the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art-based approach, analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The results show that our proposed approach outperforms AHP in terms of actual time consumption and ease of use while preserving the quality of the results obtained by our proposed approach.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0262-6,,"['Requirements prioritization', 'Functional requirements', 'Non-functional requirements', 'Software engineering', 'Requirements engineering', 'Tensor', 'Tucker decomposition', 'Multi-way analysis', 'Multi-dimensional issue']",24Citations,Springer,,Negin Misaghian,Homayun Motameni,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0262-6,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Continuous clarification and emergent requirements flows in open-commercial software ecosystems,,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",27-Sep-16,"AbstractSoftware engineering practice has shifted from the development of products in closed environments toward more open and collaborative efforts. Software development has become significantly interdependent with other systems (e.g. services, apps) and typically takes place within large ecosystems of networked communities of stakeholder organizations. Such software ecosystems promise increased innovation power and support for consumer-oriented software services at scale and are characterized by a certain openness of their information flows. While such openness supports project and reputation management, it also brings requirements engineering-related challenges within the ecosystem, such as managing dynamic, emergent contributions from the ecosystem stakeholders, as well as collecting their input while protecting their IP. In this paper, we report from a study of requirements communication and management practices within IBM®’s Collaborative Lifecycle Management® product development ecosystem. Our research used multiple methods for data collection, including interviews within several ecosystem actors, on-site participatory observation, and analysis of online project repositories. We chart and describe the flow of product requirements information through the ecosystem, how the open communication paradigm in software ecosystems provides opportunities for “just-in-time” RE—and which relies on emergent contributions from the ecosystem stakeholders—, as well as some of the challenges faced when traditional requirements engineering approaches are applied within such an ecosystem. More importantly, we discuss two tradeoffs brought about by the openness in software ecosystems: (1) allowing open, transparent communication while keeping intellectual property confidential within the ecosystem and (2) having the ability to act globally on a long-term strategy while empowering product teams to act locally to answer end users’ context-specific needs in a timely manner. A sufficient level of openness facilitates contributions of emergent stakeholders. The ability to include important emergent contributors early in requirements elicitation appears to be a crucial asset in software ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0259-1,available,"['Requirements engineering', 'Software ecosystem', 'Mixed method']",18Citations,Springer,,Eric Knauss,Aminah Yussuf,Kelly Blincoe,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0259-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Requirements for cloud-based BIM governance solutions to facilitate team collaboration in construction projects,,"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hail University, P.O. Box 2440, Hail, Saudi Arabia",20-May-16,"AbstractConstruction projects involve multidisciplinary and multi-actor collaborations that generate massive amounts of data over their lifecycle. Data are often sensitive and embody rights, ownership, and intellectual property of the creator. Managing project information raises concerns about security, inconsistency, and loss of data. Conventional approach of dealing with the complexities of data management involves the adoption of BIM-based solutions that lack suitable means for the governance of collaboration, and access and archival of managed data. To overcome the limitations of BIM, cloud-based governance solutions have been suggested as a way forward. However, there is a lack of understanding of construction Information and Communication Technology (ICT) practices from the perspectives of data management and governance. This paper aims to fill this gap: first, by exploring barriers related to BIM adoption and collaboration practices, in particular, issues related to data management and governance that can potentially be ameliorated with cloud technologies, and second, by identifying key requirements for cloud-based BIM governance solutions. A structured questionnaire was conducted among informed construction practitioners in this study. The findings reveal several barriers to BIM adoption alongside ICT and collaboration issues with an urgent need to develop a BIM governance solution underpinned by cloud technology. Further, a number of important requirements for developing BIM governance solutions have been identified.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0254-6,,"['Building information modelling (BIM)', 'BIM adoption barriers', 'BIM governance', 'Data governance', 'Construction industry', 'Cloud computing']",63Citations,Springer,,Eissa Alreshidi,Monjur Mourshed,Yacine Rezgui,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0254-6,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Using a multiple-case study approach, we collected data via 14 semi-structured interviews at one car manufacturer and one supplier. We tested our findings from the case study with a questionnaire distributed to practitioners in the automotive industry. Our results indicate that it is difficult but increasingly important to establish communication channels outside the fixed organisation structure and that responsibilities are often unclear. Product knowledge during early requirements elicitation and context knowledge later on is lacking. Furthermore, abstraction gaps between requirements on different abstraction levels leads to inconsistencies. For academia, we formulate a concrete agenda for future research.

CrowdMock: an approach for defining and evolving web augmentation requirements,,"Lifia, Facultad de Informática, UNLP, La Plata, Argentina",11-Jun-16,"Abstract Web Applications are accessed by millions of users with different needs, goals, concerns, or preferences. Several well-known Web Applications provide personalized features, e.g., they recommend specific content to users by contemplating individual characteristics or requirements. However, since most Web Application cannot consider all users’ requirements, many developers started to create their own mechanisms for adapting existing applications. One of the most popular techniques for third-party applications adaptation is Web Augmentation, which is based on the alteration of its original user interface, generally by using scripts running at the client side (e.g., the browser). In the context of Web Augmentation, two user roles have emerged: scripters who are those users able to create a new augmentation artifact, and end users without programming skills, that just consume the artifacts that may satisfy totally or partially their needs. Scripters and end users generally do not know each other, and they have rarely a contact, beyond the fact that they use the same script repositories. When end users cannot get their needs covered with existing artifacts, they claim for new ones by specifying their requirements (called Web Augmentation requirements) using textual descriptions, which are usually hard to interpret by scripters. Web Augmentation requirements are a very particular kind of Web requirements for which there partially exist a solution implemented by the Web site owner, but still users need to change or augment that implementation with very specific purposes that they desire to be available in such site. In this paper, we propose an approach for defining and evolving Web Augmentation requirements using rich visual prototypes and textual descriptions that can be automatically mapped onto running software artifacts. We present a tool implemented to support this approach, and we show an evaluation of both the approach and the tool.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0257-3,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Web engineering', 'Web augmentation']",12Citations,Springer,,Diego Firmenich,Sergio Firmenich,José Matías Rivero,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0257-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

We used four major databases IEEE, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink and ACM and Identified 270 primary studies till the year 2012. An analysis of the data extracted from primary studies shows that the empirical research work in RE is on the increase since the year 2000. The requirements elicitation with 22 % of the total studies, requirements analysis with 19 % and RE process with 17 % are the major focus areas of empirical RE research. Non-functional requirements were found to be the most researched emerging area. The empirical work in the sub-area of requirements validation and verification is little and has a decreasing trend. The majority of the studies (50 %) used a case study research method followed by experiments (28 %), whereas the experience reports are few (6 %). A common trend in almost all RE sub-areas is about proposing new interventions. The leading intervention types are guidelines, techniques and processes. The interest in RE empirical research is on the rise as whole. However, requirements validation and verification area, despite its recognized importance, lacks empirical research at present. Furthermore, requirements evolution and privacy requirements also have little empirical research. These RE sub-areas need the attention of researchers for more empirical research. At present, the focus of empirical RE research is more about proposing new interventions. In future, there is a need to replicate existing studies as well to evaluate the RE interventions in more real contexts and scenarios. The practitioners’ involvement in RE empirical research needs to be increased so that they share their experiences of using different RE interventions and also inform us about the current requirements-related challenges and issues that they face in their work.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0258-2,,"['Evidence-based software engineering', 'Requirements engineering', 'Systematic review', 'Mapping study']",50Citations,Springer,,Talat Ambreen,Naveed Ikram,Muhammad Usman,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0258-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Effective use of analysts’ effort in automated tracing,,"Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, University of Kentucky (UK), Lexington, KY, 40506-0495, USA",27-Oct-16,"AbstractBecause of the large amount of effort it takes to manually trace requirements, automated traceability methods for mapping textual software engineering artifacts to each other and generating candidate links have received increased attention over the past 15 years. Automatically generated links, however, are viewed as candidates until human analysts confirm/reject them for the final requirements traceability matrix. Studies have shown that analysts are a fallible, but necessary, participant in the tracing process. There are two key measures guiding analyst work on the evaluation of candidate links: accuracy of analyst decision and efficiency of their work. Intuitively, it is expected that the more effort the analyst spends on candidate link validation, the more accurate the final traceability matrix is likely to be, although the exact nature of this relationship may be difficult to gauge outright. To assist analysts in making the best use of their time when reviewing candidate links, prior work simulated four possible behaviors and showed that more structured approaches save the analysts’ time/effort required to achieve certain levels of accuracy. However, these behavioral simulations are complex to run and their results difficult to interpret and use in practice. In this paper, we present a mathematical model for evaluating analyst effort during requirements tracing tasks. We apply this model to a simulation study of 12 candidate link validation approaches. The simulation study is conducted on a number of different datasets. In each study, we assume perfect analyst behavior (i.e., analyst always being correct when making a determination about a link). Under this assumption, we evaluate the estimated effort for the analyst and plot it against the accuracy of the recovered traceability matrix. The effort estimation model is guided by a parameter specifying the relationship between the time it takes an analyst to evaluate a presented link and the time it takes an analyst to discover a link not presented to her. We construct a series of effort estimations based on different values of the model parameter. We found that the analysts’ approach to candidate link validation—essentially the order in which the analyst examines presented candidate links—does impact the effort. We also found that the lowest ratio of the cost of finding a correct link from scratch over the cost of recognizing a correct link yields the lowest effort for all datasets, but that the lowest effort does not always yield the highest quality matrix. We finally observed that effort varies by dataset. We conclude that the link evaluation approach we call “Top 1 Not Yet Examined Feedback Pruning” was the overall winner in terms of effort and highest quality and, thus, should be followed by human analysts if possible.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0260-8,,"['Requirements', 'Measurement', 'Traceability', 'Analysts’ effort', 'Effort model', 'Feedback']",3Citations,Springer,,Jane Huffman Hayes,Alex Dekhtyar,Jody Larsen,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0260-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A framework for quality assessment of just-in-time requirements: the case of open source feature requests,,"Fontys Applied University, Eindhoven, The Netherlands",14-Mar-16,"AbstractUntil now, quality assessment of requirements has focused on traditional up-front requirements. Contrasting these traditional requirements are just-in-time (JIT) requirements, which are by definition incomplete, not specific and might be ambiguous when initially specified, indicating a different notion of ""correctness."" We analyze how the assessment of JIT requirements quality should be performed based on the literature of traditional and JIT requirements. Based on that analysis, we have designed a quality framework for JIT requirements and instantiated it for feature requests in open source projects. We also indicate how the framework can be instantiated for other types of JIT requirements. We have performed an initial evaluation of our framework for feature requests with eight practitioners from the Dutch agile community, receiving overall positive feedback. Subsequently, we have used our framework to assess 550 feature requests originating from three Open Source Software systems (Netbeans, ArgoUML and Mylyn Tasks). In doing so, we obtain a view on the feature request quality for the three open source projects. The value of our framework is threefold: (1) it gives an overview of quality criteria that are applicable to feature requests (at creation time or JIT); (2) it serves as a structured basis for teams that need to assess the quality of their JIT requirements; and (3) it provides a way to get an insight into the quality of JIT requirements in existing projects.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0247-5,,"['Just-in-time requirement', 'Quality framework', 'Quality assessment', 'Feature request', 'Open source']",12Citations,Springer,,Petra Heck,Andy Zaidman,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0247-5,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
How to manage IS requirements in complex public sector structures: toward an action design research approach,,"Department of Management Information Systems, University of Regensburg, Universitätsstraße 31, 93053, Regensburg, Germany",03-Mar-16,"AbstractInformation systems (IS) are a key enabler to improve effectiveness and efficiency in the public sector. The realization of large IS projects, however, still remains a challenge in public administrations. One reason is that the complex task of IT governance in federal structures requires contributions from a large number of stakeholders. To address this challenge, we conducted Action Design Research in cooperation with different institutions of the German labor market and developed a requirements engineering process with a corresponding IT governance in the public sector that takes complex federal structures into account. The process was successfully implemented at the German Federal Employment Agency and proved valuable to deal with 146 municipal requirements regarding an IS in the context of unemployment benefits.

Is role playing in Requirements Engineering Education increasing learning outcome?,,"Software Engineering Research Lab Sweden, Blekinge Institute of Technology, 37140, Karlskrona, Sweden",30-Mar-16,"AbstractRequirements Engineering has attracted a great deal of attention from researchers and practitioners in recent years. This increasing interest requires academia to provide students with a solid foundation in the subject matter. In Requirements Engineering Education (REE), it is important to cover three fundamental topics: traditional analysis and modeling skills, interviewing skills for requirements elicitation, and writing skills for specifying requirements. REE papers report about using role playing as a pedagogical tool; however, there is a surprising lack of empirical evidence on its utility. In this paper we investigate whether a higher grade in a role playing project have an effect on students’ score in an individual written exam in a Requirements Engineering course. Data are collected from 412 students between the years of 2007 and 2014 at Lund University and Chalmers | University of Gothenburg.

Validation of formal specifications through transformation and animation,,"Software Competence Center Hagenberg GmbH, Hagenberg, Austria",16-Mar-16,"AbstractA significant impediment to the uptake of formal refinement-based methods among practitioners is the challenge of validating that the formal specifications of these methods capture the desired intents. Animation of specifications is widely recognized as an effective way of addressing such validation. However, animation tools are unable to directly execute (and thus animate) the typical uses of several of the specification constructs often found in ideal formal specifications. To address this problem, we have developed transformation heuristics that, starting with an ideal formal specification, guide its conversion into an animatable form. We show several of these heuristics and address the need to prove that the application of these transformations preserves the relevant behavior of the original specification. Portions of several case studies illustrate this approach.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0246-6,,"['Formal methods', 'Requirements specifications', 'Validation', 'Animation', 'Event-B']",7Citations,Springer,,Atif Mashkoor,Jean-Pierre Jacquot,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0246-6,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Understanding requirement prioritization artifacts: a systematic mapping study,,"Information Systems Department, Xavier Institute of Management (XIMB), Xavier Square, Bhubaneswar, 751 013, India",10-May-16,"AbstractThe importance of prioritizing requirements stems from the fact that not all requirements can usually be met with available time and resource constraints. Efficient and trustworthy methods for prioritizing requirements are therefore in high demand.

The results emphasize the heightened attention the domain of requirement prioritization has received in recent years. On the basis of this study, we are able to provide the following inferences regarding possible future research trajectories in software requirement prioritization artifacts: (1) focus on frameworks and tools; (2) emphasis on specialization; and (3) proposition of theory-based artifacts.

Dealing with software process requirements complexity: an information access proposal based on semantic technologies,,"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, c/Madrid, 128, Getafe, Madrid, Spain",04-Jun-16,"AbstractOrganizations developing software for critical sectors like aerospace, automotive, and medical systems need to apply process requirements coming from different sources: industrial standards, customer-provided requirements, and procedures from internal quality management systems. In these situations, software teams need to deal with complex sets of process requirements that govern different aspects of their work. This paper describes the development of a collaborative, web-based solution to improve access to process requirements. The solution makes use of semantic technologies to handle the context of process requirement. Requirements are contextualized by linking them to activities, tasks, and work products.

Viewpoint: effectiveness of focused mentoring to improve requirements engineering industrial practice,,"Intel Corporation, 2200 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, CA, 95054, USA",27-Apr-17,"AbstractRequirements engineering practice in industry is often encumbered by practical limits of time, resource, and attention. In our environment, most requirements authors have had no formal training in the practice, yet are expected to produce high-quality specifications that drive subsequent work. Authors are often unaware of different techniques for requirements specification and are rarely equipped to navigate all of the techniques and tools that are potentially available to them, to the extent that they are even aware of the various options. A small cadre of coaches, providing focused, just-in-time mentoring of authors in a handful of basic techniques can increase the proficiency of these authors, who in turn produce higher-quality requirements specifications. From this foundation, authors may be able to later adopt additional techniques to further improve the quality and maturity of their work, thus resulting in improved work products built on the basis of those specifications.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0269-7,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Requirements specification', 'Mentoring', 'Specification quality', 'Defect density']",1Citation,Springer,,Sarah C.

Advancing viewpoint merging in requirements engineering: a theoretical replication and explanatory study,,"University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA",19-May-17,"AbstractCompared to building a single requirements view, modeling stakeholder viewpoints and then merging them is shown to improve the understanding of the problem domain, but also very time-consuming. How has the situation changed? This paper reports our replication of a case study, where we take advantage of theoretical replication to mitigate one of the original study design’s threats and to embrace an important evolving factor, namely automated tool support for producing \(i*\) models. Our replicate study updates the prior results by showing the time saving enabled by the tool and verifies the rich domain understanding gained through viewpoint-based modeling. In an attempt to explain why viewpoints lead to richer domain understanding, we examine in a posteriori way the role that traceability plays in building individual and team-wide requirements models. Our post hoc analysis results suggest that better traceability from the sources makes team-level requirements modeling more focused, whereas the lack of traceability makes it less fruitful. Our work not only shifts the case study from an exploratory to an explanatory nature, but also proposes the integration of conflict-centric views into viewpoint merging to further improve the understanding about stakeholder requirements’ trade-offs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0271-0,,"['Replication', 'Theoretical replication', 'Viewpoints', 'Model merging', 'Comparative study', 'Scholar@UC', '\n\\(i*\\)\n', 'Traceability']",29Citations,Springer,,Charu Khatwani,Xiaoyu Jin,Nan Niu,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-017-0271-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
An exploratory study of Twitter messages about software applications,,"University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",15-Jul-17,"AbstractUsers of the Twitter microblogging platform share a considerable amount of information through short messages on a daily basis. Some of these so-called tweets discuss issues related to software and could include information that is relevant to the companies developing these applications. Such tweets have the potential to help requirements engineers better understand user needs and therefore provide important information for software evolution. However, little is known about the nature of tweets discussing software-related issues. In this paper, we report on the usage characteristics, content and automatic classification potential of tweets about software applications. Our results are based on an exploratory study in which we used descriptive statistics, content analysis, machine learning and lexical sentiment analysis to explore a dataset of 10,986,495 tweets about 30 different software applications. Our results show that searching for relevant information on software applications within the vast stream of tweets can be compared to looking for a needle in a haystack.

Challenges of working with artifacts in requirements engineering and software engineering,,"Department of Informatics, University of Zurich, Binzmühlestrasse 14, 8050, Zurich, Switzerland",23-May-17,"AbstractWhen developing or evolving software systems of non-trivial size, having the requirements properly documented is a crucial success factor. The time and effort required for creating and maintaining non-code artifacts are significantly influenced by the tools with which practitioners view, navigate and edit these artifacts. This is not only true for requirements, but for any artifacts used when developing or evolving systems. However, there is not much evidence about how practitioners actually work with artifacts and how well software tools support them. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study based on 29 interviews with software practitioners to understand the current practice of presenting and manipulating artifacts in tools, how practitioners deal with the challenges encountered, and how these challenges affect the usability of the tools used. We found that practitioners typically work with several interrelated artifacts concurrently, less than half of these artifacts can be displayed entirely on a large screen, the artifact interrelationship information is often missing, and practitioners work collaboratively on artifacts without sufficient support. We identify the existing challenges of working with artifacts and discuss existing solutions proposed addressing them. Our results contribute to the body of knowledge about how practitioners work with artifacts when developing or evolving software, the challenges they are faced with, and the attempts to address these challenges.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-017-0272-z,,"['Documentation', 'Artifacts', 'Requirements engineering', 'Software engineering tools', 'Collaboration', 'Interview', 'Exploratory study']",12Citations,Springer,,Parisa Ghazi,Martin Glinz,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-017-0272-z,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Extracting conceptual models from user stories with Visual Narrator,,"Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University, Princetonplein 5, 3584 CC, Utrecht, The Netherlands",20-May-17,"AbstractExtracting conceptual models from natural language requirements can help identify dependencies, redundancies, and conflicts between requirements via a holistic and easy-to-understand view that is generated from lengthy textual specifications. Unfortunately, existing approaches never gained traction in practice, because they either require substantial human involvement or they deliver too low accuracy. In this paper, we propose an automated approach called Visual Narrator based on natural language processing that extracts conceptual models from user story requirements. We choose this notation because of its popularity among (agile) practitioners and its focus on the essential components of a requirement: Who? What? Why? Coupled with a careful selection and tuning of heuristics, we show how Visual Narrator enables generating conceptual models from user stories with high accuracy.

A method of software requirements specification and validation for global software development,,"Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia",19-Nov-15,"AbstractGlobal software development (GSD), where software teams are located in different parts of the world, has become increasingly popular. To devise a high-quality software requirements specification (SRS), effective communication and collaboration between stakeholders are necessary for GSD. However, geographical distance, cultural diversity, differences in time zones and language barriers create difficulties for stakeholders in engaging in effective collaboration. Taking into consideration the factors involved in GSD, previous research showed that the ways by which requirements are documented and validated for collocated software development projects cannot be used effectively for GSD. In this paper, we present a method of GSD requirements specification and validation. Our method begins with generating a requirements graph to understand details of the software requirements with respect to different GSD sites. The information obtained from a requirements graph is to be contained in a requirements specification document, and then be circulated between different GSD sites for reviewing, updating and finalizing its content. Finally, the requirements contained in the specification document are to be validated by generating and comparing validation matrices at different GSD sites. Past researchers used student groups in a university environment to play the roles of stakeholders in experiments in GSD studies. We therefore validate our method by applying it to a case study of an online shopping system, where the roles of stakeholders were played by a group of students.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0240-4,,"['Software requirements specification', 'Global software development', 'Distributed teams', 'Requirements validation']",19Citations,Springer,,Naveed Ali,Richard Lai,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-015-0240-4,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Reusing functional software requirements in small-sized software enterprises: a model oriented to the catalog of requirements,,"Universidad Tecnologica de la Mixteca, Huajuapan de León, Mexico",07-Jan-16,"AbstractSoftware reuse can be defined as the process of creating software products from the existing ones rather than developing software from scratch. Thus, software reuse is normally proposed to increase software productivity and quality and leads to economic benefits. In this sense, the reuse of software requirements has received important attention because it provides a solid support to develop quality software through obtaining and reusing quality software requirements [i.e., software product line (SPL) approach used in large-sized software enterprises]. However, the small-sized enterprises—which represent up to 85 % of all software organizations in many countries around the world—cannot implement a SPL approach because it does not fit with the context, properties, and complexity of their software projects. Moreover, the software engineering community has not adequately explored a more proper approach in the context of small-sized software enterprises. The use of a software requirements catalog could be this proper approach. In this context, the aim of this paper was to introduce the requirements reuse model for software requirements catalog (RRMSRC). Also, a set of guidelines to perform the main activities defined for reusing functional requirements within small-sized software enterprises is provided. As evidence of its feasibility, RRMSRC has been used in an industrial context, and the obtained results and learned lessons are summarized.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0243-1,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Requirements reuse process', 'Functional requirements catalog', 'Small-sized software enterprises']",11Citations,Springer,,C.

Repetition between stakeholder (user) and system requirements,,"Computer Science, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK",25-Sep-15,"AbstractStakeholder requirements (also known as user requirements) are defined at an early stage of a software project to describe the problem(s) to be solved. At a later stage, abstract solutions to those problems are prescribed in system requirements. The quality of these requirements has long been linked to the quality of the software system and its development or procurement process. However, little is known about the quality defect of redundancy between these two sets of requirements. Previous literature is anecdotal rather than exploratory, and so this paper empirically investigates its occurrence and consequences with a case study from a UK defense contractor. We report on a survey of sixteen consultants to understand their perception of the problem, and on an analysis of real-world software requirements documents using natural language processing techniques. We found that three quarters of the consultants had seen repetition in at least half of their projects. Additionally, we found that on average, a third of the requirement pairs’ (comprised of a system and its related stakeholder requirement) description fields were repeated such that one requirement in the pair added only trivial information. That is, solutions were described twice while their respective problems were not described, which ultimately lead to suboptimal decisions later in the development process, as well as reduced motivation to read the requirements set. Furthermore, the requirement fields considered to be secondary to the primary “description” field, such as the “rationale” or “fit criterion” fields, had considerably more repetition within UR–SysR pairs. Finally, given that the UR–SysR repetition phenomena received most of its discussion in the literature over a decade ago, it is interesting that the survey participants did not consider its occurrence to have declined since then. We provide recommendations on preventing the defect, and describe the freely available tool developed to automatically detect its occurrence and alleviate its consequences.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0239-x,,"['User requirements', 'Stakeholder requirements', 'System requirements', 'Duplicate detection', 'Redundancy']",10Citations,Springer,,Richard Ellis-Braithwaite,Russell Lock,Ray Dawson,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-015-0239-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
An automated framework for detection and resolution of cross references in legal texts,,"Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 4 rue Alphonse Weicker, 2721, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",17-Nov-15,"AbstractWhen identifying and elaborating compliance requirements, analysts need to follow the cross references in legal texts and consider the additional information in the cited provisions. Enabling easier navigation and handling of cross references requires automated support for the detection of the natural language expressions used in cross references, the interpretation of cross references in their context, and the linkage of cross references to the targeted provisions. In this article, we propose an approach and tool support for automated detection and resolution of cross references. The approach leverages the structure of legal texts, formalized into a schema, and a set of natural language patterns for legal cross reference expressions. These patterns were developed based on an investigation of Luxembourg’s legislation, written in French. To build confidence about their applicability beyond the context where they were observed, these patterns were validated against the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) by the Government of Ontario, Canada, written in both French and English.

A traditional choice for such a kind of modeling is a logic-based approach.

Moreover, some authors established some practical limitations with temporal logics expressive power. In this work, we present omega-feather weight visual scenarios (\(\omega\)-FVS) a declarative language, not founded on temporal logics, but on simple graphical scenarios, powerful enough to express \(\omega\)-regular properties.

Agile requirements handling in a service-oriented taxonomy of capabilities,,"FFI (Norwegian Defence Research Establishment), PB. 25, 2027, Kjeller, Norway",30-Jan-16,"AbstractTo get to grips with information systems portfolio development, strategic decisions tend towards service orientation and cloud deployment. Functionality should be presented as services that can be consumed from secure clouds in a range of contexts, and service-oriented architectures should enable one to build and rebuild systems portfolios readily and rapidly. However, there is little practical guidance on how to organize and coordinate the multiple lines of work that developing, or modernizing to, a service-oriented portfolio entails. We outline a method framework that uses the structure of a service-oriented taxonomy of capabilities to organize requirements and development in terms of elaboration and refinement of requirements. The method compiles several best practices and supports independent, but integral, lines of work that can be organized in small-scale projects. We illustrate the framework on three cases that involve computer- and simulation-assisted business processes. We conclude that service-oriented capability taxonomies can be used to structure and discipline requirements handling at all levels, from enterprise strategy to technical systems. We suggest that our framework supports the development of capabilities and services that are persistent in the service-oriented sense relative to each other and to implementation. We suggest further that the framework supports collaborative work by facilitating shared conceptions across lines of work.

Engineering requirements for adaptive systems,,"FBK Center for Communication and Information Technology, 38123, Povo, Trento, TN, Italy",27-Aug-15,"Abstract
The increasing demand for complex and distributed software calls for novel software engineering methods and techniques, to create systems able to autonomously adapt to dynamically changing situations. In this paper, we present a framework for engineering requirements for adaptive software systems. The approach, called Tropos4AS, combines goal-oriented concepts and high-variability design methods.
 The Tropos4AS requirements model can be directly mapped to software prototypes with an agent-oriented architecture which can be executed for requirements validation and refinement. We give a comprehensive description of the framework, with conceptual models, modelling guidelines, and supporting tools. The applicability of the framework to requirements validation and refinement is illustrated through a case study. Two controlled experiments with subjects provide an empirical evaluation of the proposed modelling language, with statistical evidence of the effectiveness of the modelling approach for gathering requirements of adaptive systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0236-0,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Agent-oriented software engineering', 'Adaptive software', 'BDI agents', 'Empirical study']",38Citations,Springer,,Mirko Morandini,Loris Penserini,Anna Perini,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-015-0236-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Structuring automotive product lines and feature models: an exploratory study at Opel,,"Capgemini, Frankfurt, Germany",22-Aug-15,"AbstractAutomotive systems are highly complex and customized systems containing a vast amount of variability. 
Feature modeling plays a key role in customization. Empirical evidence through industry application, and in particular methodological guidance of how to structure automotive product lines and their feature models is needed. The overall aim of this work is to provide guidance to practitioners how to structure automotive product lines and their feature models, understanding strengths and weaknesses of alternative structures. The research was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, the context situation was understood using interviews and workshops. In the second phase, possible structures of product lines and feature models were evaluated based on industry feedback collected in workshops. In the third phase, the structures were implemented in the tool GEARS and practitioner feedback was collected. One key challenge was the unavailability of structuring guidelines, which was the focus of this research. The structures considered most suitable for the automotive product line were multiple product lines with modular decomposition. The structures most suitable for the feature model were functional decomposition, using context variability, models corresponding to assets, and feature categories. Other structures have been discarded, and the rationales have been presented. It was possible to support the most suitable structures with the commercial tool GEARS. The implementation in GEARS and the feedback from the practitioners provide early indications for the potential usefulness of the structures and the tool implementation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0237-z,,"['Feature modeling', 'Variability modeling', 'Product line engineering', 'Case study', 'Empirical', 'Automotive']",16Citations,Springer,,Olesia Oliinyk,Kai Petersen,Manfred Schoelzke,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-015-0237-z,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Modelling mobile app requirements for semantic traceability,,"Faculty of Economic Sciences and Business Administration, University Babes-Bolyai of Cluj Napoca, Str. Teodor Mihali 58-60, 400591, Cluj Napoca, Romania",28-Jul-15,"AbstractThe paper presents a modelling method aimed to support the definition and elicitation of requirements for mobile apps through an approach that enables semantic traceability for the requirements representation. Business process-centricity is employed in order to capture requirements in a knowledge structure that retains procedural knowledge from stakeholders and can be traversed by semantic queries in order to trace domain-specific contextual information for the modelled requirements. Consequently, instead of having requirements represented as natural language items that are documented by diagrammatic models, the communication channels are switched: semantically interlinked conceptual models become the requirements representation, while free text can be used for requirements annotations/metadata. Thus, the method establishes a knowledge externalization channel between business stakeholders and app developers, also tackling the Twin Peaks bridging challenge (between requirements and early designs). The method is presented using its modelling procedure as a guiding thread, with each step illustrated by case-based samples of the modelling language and auxiliary functionality. The design work is encompassed by an existing metamodelling framework and introduces a taxonomy for modelling relations, since the metamodel is the key enabler for the goal of semantic traceability. The research was driven by the ComVantage EU research project, concerned with mobile app support for collaborative business process execution. Therefore, the project provides context for the illustrating examples; however, generalization possibilities beyond the project scope will also be discussed, with respect to both motivation and outcome.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0235-1,,"['Mobile app requirements', 'Mobile interaction', 'Linked Data', 'Requirements modelling', 'Semantic traceability']",31Citations,Springer,,Robert Andrei Buchmann,Dimitris Karagiannis,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-015-0235-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
The role of distances in requirements communication: a case study,,"Department of Computer Science, Lund University, Box 118, SE-221 00, Lund, Sweden",26-Jul-15,"AbstractRequirements communication plays a vital role in development projects in coordinating the customers, the business roles and the software engineers. Communication gaps represent a significant source of project failures and overruns. For example, misunderstood or uncommunicated requirements can lead to software that does not meet the customers’ requirements, and subsequent low number of sales or additional cost required to redo the implementation. We propose that requirements engineering (RE) distance measures are useful for locating gaps in requirements communication and for improving on development practice. In this paper, we present a case study of one software development project to evaluate this proposition. Thirteen RE distances were measured including geographical and cognitive distances between project members, and semantic distances between requirements and testing artefacts. The findings confirm that RE distances impact requirements communication and project coordination. Furthermore, the concept of distances was found to enable constructive group reflection on communication gaps and improvements to development practices. The insights reported in this paper can provide practitioners with an increased awareness of distances and their impact. Furthermore, the results provide a stepping stone for further research into RE distances and methods for improving on software development processes and practices.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0233-3,,"['Case study', 'Communication', 'Requirements', 'Testing', 'Measurements', 'Agile', 'Distances']",31Citations,Springer,,Elizabeth Bjarnason,Helen Sharp,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-015-0233-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Mapping quality requirements for pervasive mobile games,,"MediaLab/Institute of Computing, UFF, Av. Gal. Milton Tavares de Souza, s/nº, São Domingos, Niterói, RJ, 24210-346, Brazil",14-Sep-15,"AbstractGames have not received the full attention of the requirements engineering community. This scenario is becoming more critical as we move towards newer forms of games, such as pervasive games. Pervasiveness (the quality that distinguishes pervasive games from traditional digital games) holds several meanings, including being ubiquitous, permeating something, or spreading something, somewhere, in a physical space. Pervasiveness can be recognized in by the boundaries of the game expanding every time it is played, from the virtual (or fictional) world to the real world. Pervasive games are a new form of digital entertainment that has evolved in different forms, such as alternate reality games, transmedia games, and crossmedia games. Sensor technologies, networking capabilities, augmented reality systems, computer vision technology, the internet, and, especially, mobile devices have been responsible for the rapid evolution of this new form of digital product. This paper is focused on “pervasive mobile games”, which we define as context-aware games that use mobile devices. We bear in mind that mobile devices are currently the main driver for fulfilling the promises of pervasive game playing. Our investigations and experiments on this class of games led us to study the quality requirements for pervasive mobile games. Using different information sources, we gathered a set of interrelated characteristics that are crucial to the success of these games. In this paper, we begin to clarify the definition and scope of pervasive mobile games, which are controversial issues in the literature. Using these fundamentals, we propose a two-level conceptual map of non-functional requirements that helps to realize pervasiveness in pervasive mobile games. These non-functional requirements are then associated with a set of questions that help the designers in verifying tasks and operationalizing the requirements of a game. We also propose a dependence matrix for pervasive game qualities that enhances the insight into pervasiveness and reveals important guidelines for the game designers.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0238-y,,"['Pervasive mobile games', 'Requirements engineering', 'Non-functional requirements', 'Dependence matrix']",19Citations,Springer,,Luis Valente,Bruno Feijó,Julio Cesar Sampaio do Prado Leite,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-015-0238-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Automating trade-off analysis of security requirements,,"Lero - the Irish Software Engineering Research Centre, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",12-May-15,"AbstractA key aspect of engineering secure systems is identifying adequate security requirements to protect critical assets from harm. However, security requirements may compete with other requirements such as cost and usability. For this reason, they may only be satisfied partially and must be traded off against other requirements to achieve “good-enough security”. This paper proposes a novel approach to automate security requirements analysis in order to determine maximum achievable satisfaction level for security requirements and identify trade-offs between security and other requirements. We also propose a pruning algorithm to reduce the search space size in the analysis. We represent security concerns and requirements using asset, threat, and goal models, initially proposed in our previous work. To deal with uncertainty and partial requirements, satisfaction security concerns are quantified by leveraging the notion of composite indicators, which are computed through metric functions based on range normalisation. An SMT solver (Z3) interprets the models and automates the execution of our analyses. We illustrate and evaluate our approach by applying it to a substantive example of a service-based application for exchanging emails.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0229-z,,"['Security requirements', 'Trade-off analysis', 'Goals']",15Citations,Springer,,Liliana Pasquale,Paola Spoletini,Mazeiar Salehie,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-015-0229-z,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Workshop videos for requirements communication,,"Blekinge Institute of Technology, SERL-Sweden, Campus Gräsvik, 371 79, Karlskrona, Sweden",22-Jun-15,"AbstractShared understanding of requirements between stakeholders and the development team is a critical success factor for requirements engineering. Workshops are an effective means for achieving such shared understanding. Stakeholders and team representatives can meet and discuss what a planned software system should be and how it should support achieving stakeholder goals. However, some important intended recipients of the requirements are often not present in such workshops: the developers. Thus, they cannot benefit from the in-depth understanding of the requirements and of the rationales for these requirements that develops during the workshops. The simple handover of a requirements specification hardly compensates the rich requirements understanding that is needed for the development of an acceptable system. To compensate the lack of presence in a requirements workshop, we propose to record that requirements workshop on video. If workshop participants agree to be recorded, a video is relatively simple to create and can capture much more aspects about requirements and rationales than a specification document. This paper presents the workshop video technique and a phenomenological evaluation of its use for requirements communication from the perspective of software developers. The results show how the technique was appreciated by observers of the video, present positive and negative feedbacks from the observers, and lead to recommendations for implementing the technique in practice.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0231-5,,"['Workshop videos', 'Requirements communication', 'Video analysis', 'Developer perception', 'Phenomenological evaluation']",10Citations,Springer,,Samuel A.

Applications of ontologies in requirements engineering: a systematic review of the literature,,"Systems and Computing Department, Federal University of Campina Grande, Campina Grande, PB,  58109-900, Brazil",14-Feb-15,"AbstractThere is an increase use of ontology-driven approaches to support requirements engineering (RE) activities, such as elicitation, analysis, specification, validation and management of requirements. However, the RE community still lacks a comprehensive understanding of how ontologies are used in RE process. Thus, the main objective of this work is to investigate and better understand how ontologies support RE as well as identify to what extent they have been applied to this field. In order to meet our goal, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the primary studies on the use of ontologies in RE, following a predefined review protocol. We then identified the main RE phases addressed, the requirements modelling styles that have been used in conjunction with ontologies, the types of requirements that have been supported by the use of ontologies and the ontology languages that have been adopted. We also examined the types of contributions reported and looked for evidences of the benefits of ontology-driven RE. In summary, the main findings of this work are: (1) there are empirical evidences of the benefits of using ontologies in RE activities both in industry and academy, specially for reducing ambiguity, inconsistency and incompleteness of requirements; (2) the majority of studies only partially address the RE process; (3) there is a great diversity of RE modelling styles supported by ontologies; (4) most studies addressed only functional requirements; (5) several studies describe the use/development of tools to support different types of ontology-driven RE approaches; (6) about half of the studies followed W3C recommendations on ontology-related languages; and (7) a great variety of RE ontologies were identified; nevertheless, none of them has been broadly adopted by the community.

Bayesian networks for enhancement of requirements engineering: a literature review,,"Departamento de Informática, Universidad de Almería, Ctra. Sacramento s/n, Edificio Científico Técnico III Matemáticas e Informática (CITE III), Planta 2, Despacho 2.19.0, 04120, Almería, Spain",08-May-15,"AbstractRequirements analysis is the software engineering stage that is closest to the users’ world. It also involves tasks that are knowledge intensive. 
Thus, the use of Bayesian networks (BNs) to model this knowledge would be a valuable aid. These probabilistic models could manage the imprecision and ambiguities usually present in requirements engineering (RE). In this work, we conduct a literature review focusing on where and how BNs are applied on subareas of RE in order to identify which gaps remain uncovered and which methods might engineers employ to incorporate this intelligent technique into their own requirements processes. The scarcity of identified studies (there are only 20) suggests that not all RE areas have been properly investigated in the literature. The evidence available for adopting BNs into RE is sufficiently mature yet the methods applied are not easily translatable to other topics. Nonetheless, there are enough studies supporting the applicability of synergistic cooperation between RE and BNs. This work provides a background for understanding the current state of research encompassing RE and BNs. Functional, non-functional and -ilities requirements artifacts are enhanced by the use of BNs. These models were obtained by interacting with experts or by learning from databases. The most common criticism from the point of view of BN experts is that the models lack validation, whereas requirements engineers point to the lack of a clear application method for BNs and the lack of tools for incorporating them as built-in help functions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0225-3,,"['Bayesian networks', 'Requirements engineering', 'Literature review']",24Citations,Springer,,Isabel M. del Águila,José del Sagrado,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-015-0225-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Systems performance prediction using requirements quality attributes classification,,"School of Systems Engineering and Applied Science, George Washington University, Washington, DC, 20052, USA",07-Jul-15,"AbstractPoor requirements definition can adversely impact system cost and performance for government acquisition programs. This can be mitigated by ensuring requirements statements are written in a clear and unambiguous manner with high linguistic quality. This paper introduces a statistical model that uses requirements quality factors to predict system operational performance. This work explores four classification techniques (Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor) to develop the predictive model. This model is created using empirical data from current major acquisition programs within the federal government. Operational Requirements Documents and Operational Test Reports are the data sources, respectively, for the system requirements statements and the accompanying operational test results used for model development. A commercial-off-the-shelf requirements quality analysis tool is used to determine the requirements linguistic quality metrics used in the model. Subsequent to model construction, the predictive value of the model is confirmed through execution of a sensitivity analysis, cross-validation of the data, and an overfitting analysis. Lastly, Receiver Operating Characteristics are examined to determine the best performing model. In all, the results establish that requirements quality is indeed a predictive factor for end-system operational performance, and the resulting statistical model can influence requirements development based on likelihood of successful operational performance.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0232-4,,"['Poor requirements', 'Requirements definition', 'Requirements engineering', 'Requirements quality attributes', 'Natural language requirements']",6Citations,Springer,,John L.

Designing and assessing a course on prioritization and importance assessment in strategic non-routine requirements engineering processes,,"School of Management and Governance, University of Twente, PO Box 217, 7500 AE, Enschede, The Netherlands",06-Jun-15,"AbstractIn this contribution,
 we present a course for making stakeholders in requirements engineering (RE) processes aware of the relevance of importance assessment (the thinking process that they go through while assessing requirement weights) and giving them some experience with specific aspects of the importance assessment process. We also analyze the experiences of the participants in five pilot sessions. In RE instruments, elicitation of requirement weights receives much attention. However, the processes that individual stakeholders go through while assessing weights are largely ignored or seen as a ‘black box’. In the course, participants gain experience with some common issues and pitfalls in assessing weights. Issues covered are: completeness and interdependence of requirements, causal relationships and the common denominator, handling ‘irrational’ requirements, and the meaning of ‘importance’ (priority). The course was given in various large organizations in the aerospace sector, and data on participants’ experiences were gathered by means of a standardized questionnaire. The extent to which the participants claimed they learned about the relevance of importance assessment and about how to perform it were, respectively, 2.89 and 2.72 on a scale from 1 to 5. The relevance of the various assignments was rated between 3.74 and 4.00 on a 1–5 scale. Our study indicates that the course,

On the automatic classification of app reviews,,"Department of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",14-May-16,"AbstractApp stores like Google Play and Apple AppStore have over 3 million apps covering nearly every kind of software and service. Billions of users regularly download, use, and review these apps. Recent studies have shown that reviews written by the users represent a rich source of information for the app vendors and the developers, as they include information about bugs, ideas for new features, or documentation of released features. The majority of the reviews, however, is rather non-informative just praising the app and repeating to the star ratings in words. This paper introduces several probabilistic techniques to classify app reviews into four types: bug reports, feature requests, user experiences, and text ratings. For this, we use review metadata such as the star rating and the tense, as well as, text classification, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis techniques. We conducted a series of experiments to compare the accuracy of the techniques and compared them with simple string matching. We found that metadata alone results in a poor classification accuracy. When combined with simple text classification and natural language preprocessing of the text—particularly with bigrams and lemmatization—the classification precision for all review types got up to 88–92 % and the recall up to 90–99 %. Multiple binary classifiers outperformed single multiclass classifiers. Our results inspired the design of a review analytics tool, which should help app vendors and developers deal with the large amount of reviews, filter critical reviews, and assign them to the appropriate stakeholders. We describe the tool main features and summarize nine interviews with practitioners on how review analytics tools including ours could be used in practice.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0251-9,,"['User feedback', 'Review analytics', 'Software analytics', 'Machine learning', 'Natural language processing', 'Data-driven requirements engineering']",165Citations,Springer,,Walid Maalej,Zijad Kurtanović,Hadeer Nabil,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0251-9,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

"Detecting, classifying, and tracing non-functional software requirements",,"Division of Computer Science and Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, 70803, USA",04-May-16,"AbstractIn this paper, we describe a novel unsupervised approach for detecting, classifying, and tracing non-functional software requirements (NFRs). The proposed approach exploits the textual semantics of software functional requirements (FRs) to infer potential quality constraints enforced in the system. In particular, we conduct a systematic analysis of a series of word similarity methods and clustering techniques to generate semantically cohesive clusters of FR words. These clusters are classified into various categories of NFRs based on their semantic similarity to basic NFR labels. Discovered NFRs are then traced to their implementation in the solution space based on their textual semantic similarity to source code artifacts. Three software systems are used to conduct the experimental analysis in this paper. The results show that methods that exploit massive sources of textual human knowledge are more accurate in capturing and modeling the notion of similarity between FR words in a software system. Results also show that hierarchical clustering algorithms are more capable of generating thematic word clusters than partitioning clustering techniques. In terms of performance, our analysis indicates that the proposed approach can discover, classify, and trace NFRs with accuracy levels that can be adequate for practical applications.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0252-8,,"['Classification', 'Non-functional requirements', 'Information retrieval', 'Semantics']",45Citations,Springer,,Anas Mahmoud,Grant Williams,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0252-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Ambiguity and tacit knowledge in requirements elicitation interviews,,"CNR-ISTI, Pisa, Italy",26-Mar-16,"AbstractInterviews are the most common and effective means to perform requirements elicitation and support knowledge transfer between a customer and a requirements analyst. Ambiguity in communication is often perceived as a major obstacle for knowledge transfer, which could lead to unclear and incomplete requirements documents. In this paper, we analyze the role of ambiguity in requirements elicitation interviews, when requirements are still tacit ideas to be surfaced. To study the phenomenon, we performed a set of 34 customer–analyst interviews. This experience was used as a baseline to define a framework to categorize ambiguity. The framework presents the notion of ambiguity as a class of four main sub-phenomena, namely unclarity, multiple understanding, incorrect disambiguation and correct disambiguation. We present examples of ambiguities from our interviews to illustrate the different categories, and we highlight the pragmatic components that determine the occurrence of ambiguity. Along the study, we discovered a peculiar relation between ambiguity and tacit knowledge in interviews. Tacit knowledge is the knowledge that a customer has but does not pass to the analyst for any reason. From our experience, we have discovered that, rather than an obstacle, the occurrence of an ambiguity is often a resource for discovering tacit knowledge. Again, examples are presented from our interviews to support this vision.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-016-0249-3,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Requirements elicitation ', 'Interviews', 'Ambiguity', 'Natural language']",65Citations,Springer,,Alessio Ferrari,Paola Spoletini,Stefania Gnesi,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-016-0249-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Finding and resolving security misusability with misusability cases,,"Bournemouth University, Poole, UK",02-Dec-14,"Abstract
Although widely used for both security and usability concerns, scenarios used in security design may not necessarily inform the design of usability, and vice-versa. One way of using scenarios to bridge security and usability involves explicitly describing how design decisions can lead to users inadvertently exploiting vulnerabilities to carry out their production tasks. This paper describes how misusability cases, scenarios that describe how design decisions may lead to usability problems subsequently leading to system misuse, address this problem. We describe the related work upon which misusability cases are based before presenting the approach, and illustrating its application using a case study example. Finally, we describe some findings from this approach that further inform the design of usable and secure systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-014-0217-8,available,"['Goals', 'Personas', 'Scenarios', 'Use cases', 'Security']",4Citations,Springer,,Shamal Faily,Ivan Fléchais,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-014-0217-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Reusable knowledge in security requirements engineering: a systematic mapping study,,"CRI, Panthéon Sorbonne University, Paris, France",25-Feb-15,"AbstractSecurity is a concern that must be taken into consideration starting from the early stages of system development. Over the last two decades, researchers and engineers have developed a considerable number of methods for security requirements engineering. Some of them rely on the (re)use of security knowledge. Despite some existing surveys about security requirements engineering, there is not yet any reference for researchers and practitioners that presents in a systematic way the existing proposals, techniques, and tools related to security knowledge reuse in security requirements engineering. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by looking into drawing a picture of the literature on knowledge and reuse in security requirements engineering. The questions we address are related to methods, techniques, modeling frameworks, and tools for and by reuse in security requirements engineering. We address these questions through a systematic mapping study. The mapping study was a literature review conducted with the goal of identifying, analyzing, and categorizing state-of-the-art research on our topic. This mapping study analyzes more than thirty approaches, covering 20 years of research in security requirements engineering. The contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) A framework was defined for analyzing and comparing the different proposals as well as categorizing future contributions related to knowledge reuse and security requirements engineering; (2) the different forms of knowledge representation and reuse were identified; and (3) previous surveys were updated.

Building a security reference architecture for cloud systems,,"Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA",06-Jan-15,"AbstractReference architectures (RAs) are useful tools to understand and build complex systems, and many cloud providers and software product vendors have developed versions of them. RAs describe at an abstract level (no implementation details) the main features of their cloud systems. Security is a fundamental concern in clouds and several cloud vendors provide security reference architectures (SRAs) to describe the security features of their services. A SRA is an abstract architecture describing a conceptual model of security for a cloud system and provides a way to specify security requirements for a wide range of concrete architectures. We propose here a method to build a SRA for clouds defined using UML models and patterns, which goes beyond existing models in providing a global view and a more precise description. We present a metamodel as well as security and misuse patterns for this purpose. We validate our approach by showing that it can describe more precisely existing models and that it has a variety of uses. We describe in detail one of these uses, a way of evaluating the security level of a SRA.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-014-0218-7,,"['Security reference architecture', 'Security patterns ', 'Reference architecture', 'Security requirements', 'Secure software development', 'Cloud computing', 'IaaS security']",43Citations,Springer,,Eduardo B.

Attribute-based variability in feature models,,"Department of Computer Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey",06-Nov-14,"AbstractExtended feature models enable the expression of complex cross-tree constraints involving feature attributes. The inclusion of attributes in cross-tree relations not only enriches the constraints, but also engenders an extended type of variability that involves attributes. In this article, we elaborate on the effects of this new variability type on feature models. We start by analyzing the nature of the variability involving attributes and extend the definitions of the configuration and the product to suit the emerging requirements. Next, we propose classifications for the features, configurations, and products to identify and formalize the ramifications that arise due to the new type of variability. Then, we provide a semantic foundation grounded on constraint satisfaction for our proposal. We introduce an ordering relation between configurations and show that the set of all the configurations represented by a feature model forms a semilattice. This is followed by a demonstration of how the feature model analyses will be affected using illustrative examples selected from existing and novel analysis operations. Finally, we summarize our experiences, gained from a commercial research and development project that employs an extended feature model.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-014-0216-9,,"['Software product lines', 'Extended feature models', 'Variability management', 'Variability involving attributes']",6Citations,Springer,,Ahmet Serkan Karataş,Halit Oğuztüzün,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-014-0216-9,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Analyzing and predicting software integration bugs using network analysis on requirements dependency network,,"Laboratory for Internet Software Technologies, Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China",07-Nov-14,"AbstractComplexity, cohesion and coupling have been recognized as prominent indicators of software quality. One characterization of software complexity is the existence of dependency relationships. Moreover, the degree of dependency reflects the cohesion and coupling between software elements. Dependencies in the design and implementation phase have been proven to be important predictors of software bugs. We empirically investigated how requirements dependencies correlate with and predict software integration bugs, which can provide early estimates regarding software quality and thus facilitate decision making early in the software lifecycle. We conducted network analysis on the requirements dependency networks of three commercial software projects. Significant correlation is observed between most of our network measures and the number of bugs. Furthermore, many network measures demonstrate significantly greater values for higher severity (or a higher fixing workload). Afterward, we built bug prediction models using these network measures and found that bugs can be predicted with high accuracy and sensitivity, even in cross-project and cross-company contexts. We further identified the dependency type that contributes most to bug correlation, as well as the network measures that contribute more to bug prediction. These observations show that the requirements dependency network can be used as an early indicator and predictor of software integration bugs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-014-0215-x,,"['Requirements dependency', 'Bug prediction', 'Network analysis']",11Citations,Springer,,Junjie Wang,Qing Wang,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-014-0215-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A questionnaire-based survey methodology for systematically validating goal-oriented models,,"College of Computer Science and Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, P.O.

Reasoning about the goals of a system unavoidably involves the transformation of unclear stakeholder requirements into goal-oriented models. The ability to validate goal models would support the early detection of unclear requirements, ambiguities, and conflicts. In this paper, we propose a novel validation approach based on the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL) to check the correctness of GRL goal models through statistical analyses of data collected from generated questionnaires. System stakeholders (e.g., customers, shareholders, and managers) may have different objectives, interests, and priorities. Stakeholder conflicts arise when the needs of some group of stakeholder compromise the expectations of some other group(s) of stakeholders. Our proposed approach allows for early detection of potential conflicts amongst intervening stakeholders of the system. In order to illustrate and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we apply it to a case study of a GRL model describing the fostering of the relationship between the university and its alumni.

Using security robustness analysis for early-stage validation of functional security requirements,,"Information and Computer Science Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, P.O. Box 5066, Dhahran, 31261, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia",13-Aug-14,"Abstract
Security is nowadays an indispensable requirement in software systems. Traditional software engineering processes focus primarily on business requirements, leaving security as an afterthought to be addressed via generic “patched-on” defensive mechanisms. This approach is insufficient, and software systems need to have security functionality engineered within in a similar fashion as ordinary business functional requirements. Functional security requirements need to be elicited, analyzed, specified and validated at the early stages of the development life cycle. If the functional security requirements were not properly validated, then there is a risk of developing a system that is insecure, deeming it unusable. Acceptance testing is an effective technique to validate requirements. However, an ad hoc approach to develop acceptance tests will suffer the omission of important tests. This paper presents a systematic approach to develop executable acceptance tests that is specifically geared for model-based secure software engineering processes. The approach utilizes early-stage artifacts, namely misuse case and domain models, and robustness diagrams. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to a real-world system. The results show that a comprehensive set of security acceptance tests can be developed based upon misuse case models for early-stage validation of functional security requirements.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-014-0208-9,,"['Misuse case model', 'Security robustness analysis', 'Acceptance tests', 'Functional security requirements']",11Citations,Springer,,Mohamed El-Attar,Hezam Akram Abdul-Ghani,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-014-0208-9,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

To build new visualization and analysis tools within this domain, we need to understand the unique challenges faced by these developers.

SCRAM–CK: applying a collaborative requirements engineering process for designing a web based e-science toolkit,,"School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University, Queen’s Buildings, 5 The Parade, Roath, Cardiff, Wales, CF24 3AA, UK",25-Sep-14,"Abstract
This paper presents SCRAM–CK, a method to elicit requirements by means of strong user involvement supported by prototyping activities. The method integrates two existing approaches, SCRAM and CK theory. SCRAM provides the framework for requirements management, while CK theory provides a framework for reasoning about design and its evolution. The method is demonstrated with the definition and refining of requirements for the BioVeL web toolkit. The objective of BioVeL is to allow scientists to understand, run, modify and construct workflows for data analysis with minimal training using a web-based interface. The proposed method is supported by prototyping activities for gathering user feedback, and refining requirements and design proposals. Using this method, the prototypes evolved from simple workflow execution enablers to include more complex functionalities for reviewing, modifying and building workflows in later versions. This paper presents a contribution to the application of techniques for requirements engineering. SCRAM–CK is an amalgamated method that combines a user-centred continuous refinement approach with support for design evolution through prototyping.

Interactive goal model analysis for early requirements engineering,,"Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy",24-Aug-14,"Abstract
In goal-oriented requirements engineering, goal models have been advocated to express stakeholder objectives and to capture and choose among system requirement candidates. A number of highly automated procedures have been proposed to analyze goal achievement and select alternative requirements using goal models. However, during the early stages of requirements exploration, these procedures are difficult to apply, as stakeholder goals are typically high-level, abstract, and hard-to-measure. Automated procedures often require formal representations and/or information not easily acquired in early stages (e.g., costs, temporal constraints). Consequently, early requirements engineering (RE) presents specific challenges for goal model analysis, including the need to encourage and support stakeholder involvement (through interactivity) and model improvement (through iterations). This work provides a consolidated and updated description of a framework for iterative, interactive, agent-goal model analysis for early RE. We use experiences in case studies and literature surveys to guide the design of agent-goal model analysis specific to early RE. We introduce analysis procedures for the i* goal-oriented framework, allowing users to ask “what if?” and “are certain goals achievable? how? or why not?” The i* language and our analysis procedures are formally defined. We describe framework implementation, including model visualization techniques and scalability tests. Industrial, group, and individual case studies are applied to test framework effectiveness.

Exploring cognitive style and task-specific preferences for process representations,,"Institute for Information Systems and New Media, WU - Vienna University of Economics and Business, Welthandelsplatz 1, Building D2, 1020, Vienna, Austria",04-Sep-14,"AbstractProcess models describe someone’s understanding of processes. Processes can be described using unstructured, semi-formal or diagrammatic representation forms. These representations are used in a variety of task settings, ranging from understanding processes to executing or improving processes, with the implicit assumption that the chosen representation form will be appropriate for all task settings. We explore the validity of this assumption by examining empirically the preference for different process representation forms depending on the task setting and cognitive style of the user. Based on data collected from 120 business school students, we show that preferences for process representation formats vary dependent on application purpose and cognitive styles of the participants. However, users consistently prefer diagrams over other representation formats. Our research informs a broader research agenda on task-specific applications of process modeling. We offer several recommendations for further research in this area.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-014-0210-2,,"['Conceptual modeling', 'Business process modeling', 'Representation forms', 'Model evaluation', 'User preferences', 'Cognitive style']",34Citations,Springer,,Kathrin Figl,Jan Recker,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-014-0210-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Artefact-based requirements engineering: the AMDiRE approach,,"Technische Universität München, Garching, Germany",28-May-14,"AbstractThe various influences in the processes and application domains make requirements engineering (RE) inherently complex and difficult to implement. In general, we have two options for establishing an RE approach: We can either establish an activity-based RE approach, or we can establish an artefact-based one where project participants concentrate on the RE artefacts rather than on the way of creating them. While a number of activity-based RE approaches have been proposed in recent years, we have gained much empirical evidence and experiences about the advantages of the artefact-based paradigm for RE. However, artefact orientation is still a young paradigm with various interpretations and practical manifestations whereby we need a clear understanding of its basic concepts and a consolidated and evaluated view on the paradigm. In this article, we contribute an artefact-based approach to RE [artefact model for domain-independent RE (AMDiRE)] that emerges from 6 years of experiences in fundamental and evidence-based research. To this end, we first discuss the basic notion of artefact orientation and its evolution in recent years. 
We briefly introduce a set of artefact-based RE models we developed in industrial research cooperations for different application domains and show their empirical evaluations and their dissemination into academia and practice, eventually leading to the AMDiRE approach.

Incorporating usability requirements into model transformation technologies,,"CES Laboratory, ENIS, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia",05-Oct-14,"Abstract
Model transformation plays a key role in the model-driven engineering (MDE) approach. In fact, it describes the process of converting one model into another of the same system. Considering a source model, there may be several ways to transform it into target models. Although alternative target models may be equivalent from the functional viewpoint, they may differ in their usability attributes. One of the key challenges for an automated transformation process is to identify which model transformations will produce a target model with the desired usability attributes. The present paper addresses this issue and provides a parameterized transformation to deal with usability driven in an MDE approach. Specifically, it focuses on how to associate usability attributes with the different alternative transformations and how this can be taken into account in an automated transformation process to obtain user interface model with the desired usability attributes.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-014-0213-z,,"['Usability requirement', 'Model transformation', 'Parameterized transformation']",10Citations,Springer,,Lassaad Ben Ammar,Abdelwaheb Trabelsi,Adel Mahfoudhi,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-014-0213-z,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Conviviality-driven access control policy,,"Laboratory of Advanced Software SYstems (LASSY), Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",20-Feb-14,"Abstract
Nowadays many organizations experience security incidents due to unauthorized access to information. To reduce the risk of such incidents, security policies are often employed to regulate access to information. Such policies, however, are often too restrictive, and users do not have the rights necessary to perform assigned duties. As a consequence, access control mechanisms are perceived by users as a barrier and thus bypassed, making the system insecure. In this paper, we draw a bridge between the social concept of conviviality and access control. Conviviality has been introduced as a social science concept for ambient intelligence and multi-agent systems to highlight soft qualitative requirements like user-friendliness of systems. To bridge the gap between conviviality and security, we propose a methodological framework for updating and adapting access control policies based on conviviality recommendations. Our methodology integrates and extends existing techniques to assist system designers in the derivation of access control policies from socio-technical requirements of the system, while taking into account the conviviality of the system. We illustrate our framework using the Ambient Assisted Living use case from the HotCity of Luxembourg.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-014-0204-0,,"['Conviviality', 'Access control', 'Negotiable and non-negotiable authorizations', 'Requirement model']",2Citations,Springer,,Donia El Kateb,Nicola Zannone,Assaad Moawad,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-014-0204-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
GDIA: Eliciting information requirements in emergency first response,,"School of Business and Economics, Loughborough University, Loughborough, LE11 3TU, UK",05-Feb-14,"AbstractGood information is vital for first responders in an emergency. However, although information systems can provide vast amounts of data, the information requirements of emergency first responders in complex, dynamic, ad hoc, and stressful environments cannot be systematically captured by existing requirement engineering approaches. This paper outlines the unique features of emergency response operations first and then drives an emergency-response-specific method to suit those features. The method is named as goal-directed information analysis (GDIA), which is based on but easier to use than an approach, goal-directed task analysis. We argue that goals are implicit and thus difficult to be captured from first responders because of the features of the emergency operations. GDIA starts from scenarios and has seven clearly defined and repeatable steps, including task analysis, which then leads to a simpler and more accurate analysis of the goal structure, before the rest of the hierarchy, including decisions and information requirements, is completed. A case study is presented using this GDIA approach to retrieve information requirements for four types of key fire fighters responding to a fire in a high-risk building environment.

Patterns of continuous requirements clarification,,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, 412 96, Göteborg, Sweden",13-May-14,"AbstractIn software projects involving large and often distributed teams, requirements evolve through the collaboration of many stakeholders, supported by online tools such as mailing lists, bug tracking systems, or online discussion forums. In this collaboration, requirements typically evolve from initial ideas, through clarification, to the implementation of a stable requirement. Deviations from this expected course might indicate requirements that are poorly understood, need further negotiation, or better alignment with project goals. If not addressed timely, such problems can surface late in the development cycle with negative consequences such as rework, missed schedules, or overrun budget. This paper presents an approach that provides project managers’ with timely awareness of such requirements-related risks, based on automatic analysis of stakeholders’ online requirement communication. We describe a clarification classifier that automatically analyzes requirements communication in a project and detects clarification events, a catalog of clarification patterns, and a pattern matcher that suggests communication patterns based on our pattern catalog.

On building architecture-centric product line architecture,,"Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada",29-Jan-14,"AbstractSoftware architects typically spend a great deal of time and effort exploring uncertainties, evaluating alternatives, and balancing the concerns of stakeholders. Selecting the best architecture to meet both the functional and non-functional requirements is a critical but difficult task, especially at the early stage of software development when there may be many uncertainties. For example, how will a technology match the operational or performance expectations in reality? This paper presents an approach to building architecture-centric product line. The main objective of the proposed approach is to support effective requirements validation and architectural prototyping for the application-level software. Architectural prototyping is practically essential to architecture design and evaluation. However, architectural prototyping practiced in the field mostly is not used to explore alternatives. Effective construction and evaluation of multiple architecture alternatives is one of the critically challenging tasks. The product line architecture advocated in this paper consists of multiple software architecture alternatives, from which the architect can select and rapidly generate a working application prototype. The paper presents a case study of developing a framework that is primarily built with robust architecture patterns in distributed and concurrent computing and includes variation mechanisms to support various applications even in different domains. The development process of the framework is an application of software product line engineering with an aim to effectively facilitate upfront requirements analysis for an application and rapid architectural prototyping to explore and evaluate architecture alternatives.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-014-0201-3,,"['Software product line', 'Architectural prototyping', 'Requirements validation', 'Patterns', 'Architecture evaluation', 'Software performance']",3Citations,Springer,,Chung-Horng Lung,Balasangar Balasubramaniam,Kamalachelva Selvarajah,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-014-0201-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
TiQi: answering unstructured natural language trace queries,,"DePaul University, Chicago, USA",18-Mar-15,"AbstractSoftware traceability is a required element in the development and certification of safety-critical software systems. However, trace links, which are created at significant cost and effort, are often underutilized in practice due primarily to the fact that project stakeholders often lack the skills needed to formulate complex trace queries. To mitigate this problem, we present a solution which transforms spoken or written natural language queries into structured query language (SQL). TiQi includes a general database query mechanism and a domain-specific model populated with trace query concepts, project-specific terminology, token disambiguators, and query transformation rules. We report results from four different experiments exploring user preferences for natural language queries, accuracy of the generated trace queries, efficacy of the underlying disambiguators, and stability of the trace query concepts. Experiments are conducted against two different datasets and show that users have a preference for written NL queries.

Rationalism with a dose of empiricism: combining goal reasoning and case-based reasoning for self-adaptive software systems,,"School of Computer Science, Fudan University, 825 Zhangheng Rd, Shanghai, China",14-May-15,"AbstractRequirements-driven approaches provide an effective mechanism for self-adaptive systems by reasoning over their runtime requirements models to make adaptation decisions. However, such approaches usually assume that the relations among alternative system configurations, environmental parameters and requirements are clearly understood, which is often not true. Moreover, they do not consider the influence of the current configuration of an executing system on adaptation decisions. In this paper, we propose an improved requirements-driven self-adaptation approach that combines goal reasoning and case-based reasoning. In the approach, past experiences of successful adaptations are retained as adaptation cases, which are described by not only requirements violations and contexts, but also currently deployed system configurations. The approach does not depend on a set of original adaptation cases, but employs goal reasoning to provide adaptation solutions when no similar cases are available. Case-based reasoning is used to provide more precise adaptation decisions that better reflect the complex relations among requirements violations, contexts, and current system configurations by utilizing past experiences. To prevent case-based reasoning from getting trapped in suboptimal adaptation solutions, an additional case mutation mechanism is introduced to mutate existing adaptation solutions when necessary. We conduct an experimental study with an online shopping benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that our approach outperforms both a requirements-driven approach and a case-based approach in terms of satisfaction level of quality constraints. The results also confirm the effectiveness of case mutation for producing better adaptation solutions. In addition, we empirically investigate the evolution process of adaptation solutions. The evolution analysis reveals some general evolution trends of adaptation solutions such as different evolution phases.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-015-0227-1,,"['Self-adaptive systems', 'Requirements goal models', 'Goal reasoning', 'Case-based reasoning']",12Citations,Springer,,Wenyi Qian,Xin Peng,Bihuan Chen,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-015-0227-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
On the role of semantics in automated requirements tracing,,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, 39762, USA",22-Jan-14,"Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the potential benefits of utilizing natural language semantics in automated traceability link retrieval. In particular, we evaluate the performance of a wide spectrum of semantically enabled information retrieval methods in capturing and presenting requirements traceability links in software systems. Our objectives are to gain more operational insights into these methods and to provide practical guidelines for the design and development of effective requirements tracing and management tools. To achieve our research objectives, we conduct an experimental analysis using three datasets from various application domains. Results show that considering more semantic relations in traceability link retrieval does not necessarily lead to higher quality results. Instead, a more focused semantic support, that targets specific semantic relations, is expected to have a greater impact on the overall performance of tracing tools. In addition, our analysis shows that explicit semantic methods, that exploit local or domain-specific sources of knowledge, often achieve a more satisfactory performance than latent methods, or methods that derive semantics from external or general-purpose knowledge sources.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0199-y,,"['Information retrieval', 'Traceability', 'Semantics']",55Citations,Springer,,Anas Mahmoud,Nan Niu,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0199-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A model for tracing variability from features to product-line architectures: a case study in smart grids,,"CITSEM, Technical University of Madrid (UPM) - Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Ctra. Valencia Km. 7, 28031, Madrid, Spain",07-Feb-14,"AbstractIn current software systems with highly volatile requirements, traceability plays a key role to maintain the consistency between requirements and code. Traceability between artifacts involved in the development of software product line (SPL) is still more critical because it is necessary to guarantee that the selection of variants that realize the different SPL products meet the requirements. Current SPL traceability mechanisms trace from variability in features to variations in the configuration of product-line architecture (PLA) in terms of adding and removing components. However, it is not always possible to materialize the variable features of a SPL through adding or removing components, since sometimes they are materialized inside components, i.e., in part of their functionality: a class, a service, and/or an interface. Additionally, variations that happen inside components may crosscut several components of architecture. These kinds of variations are still challenging and their traceability is not currently well supported. Therefore, it is not possible to guarantee that those SPL products with these kinds of variations meet the requirements. This paper presents a solution for tracing variability from features to PLA by taking these kinds of variations into account. This solution is based on models and traceability between models in order to automate SPL configuration by selecting the variants and realizing the product application. The FPLA modeling framework supports this solution which has been deployed in a software factory. Validation has consisted in putting the solution into practice to develop a product line of power metering management applications for smart grids.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-014-0203-1,,"['Traceability modeling', 'Software product line engineering', 'Product-line architecture', 'Variability']",11Citations,Springer,,Jessica Díaz,Jennifer Pérez,Juan Garbajosa,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-014-0203-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Leveraging topic modeling and part-of-speech tagging to support combinational creativity in requirements engineering,,"Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, USA",28-Apr-15,"Abstract
Requirements engineering (RE), framed as a creative problem solving process, plays a key role in innovating more useful and novel requirements and improving a software system’s sustainability. Existing approaches, such as creativity workshops and feature mining from web services, facilitate creativity by exploring a search space of partial and complete possibilities of requirements
. To further advance the literature, we study creativity from a combinational perspective, i.e., making unfamiliar connections between familiar possibilities of requirements. In particular, we propose a novel framework that extracts familiar ideas from the requirements and stakeholders’ comments using topic modeling, and automatically generates requirements by obtaining unfamiliar idea combinations by means of flipping the part-of-speech of identified topics. We apply our framework on two large-scale open-source software systems (Firefox and Mylyn) and report two studies to assess the viability of combinational creativity in RE. The results show that the creativity merit of requirements generated by our framework judged by human experts is comparable to that of requirements created manually. Meanwhile, the cost of our framework is significantly less than manual work, measured by time spent generating requirements. Our work illuminates a possible improvement toward interactive generation of creative requirements using mechanism’s outputs

Early modeling and validation of timed system requirements using Timed Use Case Maps,,"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, P.O. Box 1621, Dhahran, 31261, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia",29-Jan-14,"AbstractThere is a general consensus on the importance of good requirements engineering for achieving high-quality software. Functional requirements capture the intended behavior of the system in terms of services, tasks, or functions the system is required to perform, while non-functional requirements capture required properties of the system, such as timing, performance, and security. These non-functional requirements play a crucial role during system development life cycle serving as selection criteria for choosing among myriads of design decisions. The ability to model and validate the system non-functional properties at the requirements level supports the detection of design errors during the early stages of a software development life cycle and helps reduce the cost of later redesign activities. The widespread interest in time modeling and analysis techniques at the requirements phase provides the major motivation for this research. This paper presents a novel and fully automated approach to describe and validate high-level timed requirements using the Timed Use Case Maps language.
 We extend the, ITU-T standard User Requirements Notation, Use Case Maps metamodel with time requirements. The resulting extensions are implemented within the jUCMNav tool and formalized using Abstract State Machines allowing for automated simulation and analysis.

The contribution of this paper is the evaluation of STRIDE via a descriptive study that involved 57 students in their last master year in computer science. The study addresses three research questions. First, it assesses how many valid threats per hour are produced on average.

Early identification of crosscutting concerns with the Language Extended Lexicon,,"Lifia, Fac. de Informática, UNLP, Buenos Aires, Argentina",26-Nov-13,"AbstractLarge-scale software applications are complex systems that involve a myriad of different concerns. Ideally, these concerns should be organized into separated and different modules, but often some of these concerns overlap and crosscut each other. Such a situation is problematic, as concerns are tangled and scattered into different modules; thus, design and source code become difficult to produce and maintain. The Modularity community has been addressing crosscutting concerns by developing techniques based on separation of concerns. This separation must be done as early as possible during software construction to obtain a more modular and consequently better maintainable software, where evolution is performed with less effort and the possibility of introducing unforeseen mistakes is minimal. In this paper, we propose a strategy to identify crosscutting concerns at requirements level, i.e., at early stages in the software development process, by using the Language Extended Lexicon.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0193-4,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Modularity', 'Crosscutting concerns', 'Language Extended Lexicon']",3Citations,Springer,,Leandro Antonelli,Gustavo Rossi,Julio Cesar Sampaio do Prado Leite,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0193-4,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

This paper aims to identify and to present the current research on REE that is available at present, and to select useful approaches and needs for future research. A systematic mapping study was therefore performed to classify the selected studies into five classification criteria: research type, empirical type, contribution type, RE activity, and curricula.

Uni-REPM: a framework for requirements engineering process assessment,,"Blekinge Institute of Technology, 371 79, Karlskrona, Sweden",30-Oct-13,"AbstractIt has been shown that potential business benefits could be achieved by assessing and improving the requirements engineering (RE) process. However, process assessment models such as CMMI and ISO9000 only cover RE shallowly. Tailored models such as REGPG and REPM, on the other hand, do not cover market-driven requirements engineering. Other attempts such as MDREPM covers market-driven requirements engineering, but correspondingly neglects bespoke requirements engineering. Moreover, the area itself has evolved so practices that once were cutting edge are now commonplace. In this article, we develop and evaluate a unified requirements engineering process maturity model (Uni-REPM) that can be used in a market-driven as well as a bespoke context. This model is based on REPM, but has evolved to reflect contemporary requirements engineering practices. Uni-REPM is primarily created based on a systematic literature review of market-driven requirements engineering practices and a literature review of bespoke practices. Based on the results, Uni-REPM is formulated. The objective of Uni-REPM is twofold. Firstly, it is expected to be applicable for assessing the maturity of RE processes in various scenarios where an organisation would use different development approaches. Secondly, it instructs practitioners about which RE practices to perform and their expected benefits. As an assessment instrument, Uni-REPM provides a simple and low-cost solution for practitioners to identify the status of their RE process. As a guidance tool, Uni-REPM lessens the gap between theoretical and practical worlds by transferring the available RE technologies from research to industry practice.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0188-1,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Process improvement', 'Process assessment', 'Requirements engineering practices']",6Citations,Springer,,Mikael Svahnberg,Tony Gorschek,Thi Than Loan Nguyen,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0188-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Roadmapping problems in practice: value creation from the perspective of the customers,,"Aalto University, PO Box 9210, Espoo, Finland",02-Nov-13,"AbstractRoadmapping has been recognized as a critical activity for adding business value to a software product. The marketing literature has placed increasing emphasis on customer value and that value is created in customers’ everyday activities. This paper presents an action research study on the roadmapping problems of two software product companies. The key findings were that customer knowledge was fragmented across different functions of the companies and that roadmapping neglected service development. To solve these problems, the analysis of customer value and customers’ processes was integrated into roadmapping. Facilitated workshops with cross-functional teams were used to analyze the customers’ processes in their entirety and to create a holistic view to roadmapping. The lessons learned offer practical means for software companies to shift their focus from the prioritization of software features to the analysis of customers’ processes and the prioritization of customers’ activities. That shift can promote value for customers and uncover new service business opportunities. Accordingly, this paper provides a six-step approach to adopt the value-creation logic from the customers’ perspective into the existing roadmapping process of a company.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0186-3,,"['Roadmapping', 'Long-term solution planning', 'Customer value', 'Value creation', 'Requirements prioritization', 'Action research', 'Industrial experience']",20Citations,Springer,,Marko Komssi,Marjo Kauppinen,Harri Töhönen,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0186-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
GaiusT: supporting the extraction of rights and obligations for regulatory compliance,,"Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Via Sommarive, 14, 38123, Povo, TN, Italy",20-Sep-13,"Abstract
Ensuring compliance of software systems with government regulations, policies, and laws is a complex problem. Generally speaking, solutions to the problem first identify rights and obligations defined in the law and then treat these as requirements for the system under design. This work examines the challenge of developing tool support for extracting such requirements from legal documents. To address this challenge, we have developed a tool called GaiusT. The tool is founded on a framework for textual semantic annotation. It semiautomatically generates elements of requirements models, including actors, rights, and obligations. We present the complexities of annotating prescriptive text, the architecture of GaiusT, and the process by which annotation is accomplished. We also present experimental results from two case studies to illustrate the application of the tool and its effectiveness relative to manual efforts. The first case study is based on the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, while the second analyzes the Italian accessibility law for information technology instruments.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0181-8,,"['Semantic annotation', 'Legal documents', 'Requirements engineering', 'Regulation compliance problem', 'Legal requirements', 'Multilingual annotation']",56Citations,Springer,,Nicola Zeni,Nadzeya Kiyavitskaya,Luisa Mich,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0181-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Capturing consumer preferences as requirements for software product lines,,"Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, DSV, Stockholm University, Forum 100, 16440, Kista, Sweden",16-Nov-13,"Abstract
Delivering great consumer experiences in competitive market conditions requires software vendors to move away from traditional modes of thinking to an outside-in perspective, one that shifts their business to becoming consumer-centric. Requirements engineers operating in these conditions thus need new means to both capture real preferences of consumers and then relate them to requirements for software customized in different ways to fit anyone. Additionally, because system development models require inputs that are more concrete than abstract, the indistinct values of consumers need to be classified and formalized. To address this challenge, this study aims to establish a conceptual link between preferences of consumers and system requirements, using software product line (SPL) as a means for systematically accommodating the variations within the preferences. The novelty of this study is a conceptual model of consumer preference, which integrates generic value frameworks from both psychology and marketing, and a method for its transformation to requirements for SPL using a goal-oriented RE framework as the mediator. The presented artifacts are grounded in an empirical study related to the development of a system for online education.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0187-2,available,"['Value', 'Value modeling', 'Consumer value', 'SPL', 'Goal modeling', 'Features', 'Requirements']",17Citations,Springer,,Jelena Zdravkovic,Eric-Oluf Svee,Constantinos Giannoulis,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0187-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Reuse of requirements reduced time to market at one industrial shop: a case study,,"Department of Software Engineering, Afeka—Tel Aviv Academic College of Engineering, Tel Aviv, 69107, Israel",27-Sep-13,"AbstractMany a computer-based system (CBS) developed in one division of the Israel Aerospace Industries, is a derivation of formerly delivered CBSs. Sometimes, a CBS that was developed over decades needs to be redesigned for a new customer or for new technology. In addition, the requirements management process in the division has to deal with an extensive system of systems, a matrix organizational structure, and many subcontractors in order to develop any fully operational CBS. It has become obvious that any generic building block in any product developed by any project in a project family stands a chance to be reused to build new products in other projects of the same project family. Moreover, this reuse is best if it begins with the consideration of the reuse of a requirements specification of the building block, in order to save the time and money of the block’s development. The reused artifact can be the contract description of the building block, from very early in the lifecycle. Alternatively, the reused artifact can be detailed hardware and software specifications for the building block, from later in the lifecycle. With which specification reuse begins depends on the purpose of the reuse. No matter when a reuse began, it led to some significant reduction in the product’s time to market, i.e., its time to delivery. This paper is a case study of several instances in an industrial setting of building-block reuse within a large-scale system being developed in the division. It reports how these reuses were discovered and carried out. Among the contributions of this paper is a description of the division’s multilevel requirements hierarchy that is based on the multilevel architecture of the CBS to be developed. Also contributed the division’s idea of project-family-based reuse, as opposed to product-line-based reuse. The paper shows how basing reuse on a project family made proactive reuse possible. The paper then analyzes data from the division’s requirements-management tool about these reuses to assess the impact of requirements reuse on time to market. Finally, it confirms this quantitative assessment by a qualitative assessment garnered from quotations gathered from interviews of four key people two-and-a-half years after the end of the period of the case study.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0182-7,,"['Large-scale system', 'Management', 'Project family', 'Process', 'Requirements', 'Requirements management', 'Reusable software', 'Reuse', 'Specifications', 'Tools']",23Citations,Springer,,Leah Goldin,Daniel M.

Requirements engineering in software product line engineering,,"Department of Information Systems and Computation, Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, Spain",06-Nov-13,"AbstractMany attempts have been made to increase the productivity and quality of software products based on software reuse. Software product line practice is one such approach, one that focuses on developing a family of products which have a majority of features in common. Hence, there are numerous requirements that are common across the family, but others are unique to individual products. Traditional requirements engineering methods were conceived to deal with single product requirements and are usually not flexible enough to address the needs arising from reusing requirements for a family of products. There is also the additional burden of correctly identifying and engineering both product-line-wide requirements and product-specific requirements as well as evolving them.

A holistic approach to feature modeling for product line requirements engineering,,"School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK",28-Sep-13,"AbstractRequirements engineering (RE) offers the means to discover, model, and manage the requirements of the products that comprise a product line, while software product line engineering (SPLE) offers the means of realizing the products’ requirements from a common base of software assets. In practice, however, RE and SPLE have proven to be less complementary than they should. While some RE techniques, particularly goal modeling, support the exploration of alternative solutions, the appropriate solution is typically conditional on context and a large product line may have many product-defining contexts. Thus, scalability and traceability through into product line features are key challenges for RE. Feature modeling, by contrast, has been widely accepted as a way of modeling commonality and variability of products of a product line that may be very complex. In this paper, we propose a goal-driven feature modeling approach that separates a feature space in terms of problem space and solution space features, and establish explicit mappings between them. This approach contributes to reducing the inherent complexity of a mixed-view feature model, deriving key engineering drivers for developing core assets of a product line, and facilitating the quality-based product configuration.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0183-6,,"['Feature modeling', 'Product line requirements engineering', 'Goal modeling', 'Feature space', 'Feature modeling viewpoints']",10Citations,Springer,,Jaejoon Lee,Kyo C.

KMoS-RE: knowledge management on a strategy to requirements engineering",,"Knowledge and Software Engineering Center, University Autonomous of Ciudad Juárez, Av.

Requirements engineering aims to elicit, analyze, evaluate, consolidate, and manage the requirements of a software system. The complexity of this process depends on the application domain. In Informal Structured Domains, not all concepts and their relations are formally defined, most of the problems do not have algorithms to obtain solutions, and the domain specialists use large amounts of tacit knowledge to solve problems. These characteristics generate ambiguous, inappropriate, and incomplete requirements. It could generate an inadequate software solution, or it could be the cause of increasing the project development time. Therefore, it is important to use an appropriate requirements engineering strategy to minimize these problems. The objective of this study is to present the Knowledge Management on a Strategy to Requirements Engineering (KMoS-RE Strategy): a novel requirements engineering strategy oriented to the transformation and transference of knowledge, and with the aim to minimize the percentage of ambiguous, incomplete, and inappropriate requirements. The functionality and utility of the strategy is explained through its application to a real case study. The case study shows that using the KMoS-RE Strategy helps to internalize the domain knowledge, to clarify the solution idea, to reduce the ignorance of symmetry, to structure the domain knowledge, and to detect and correct wrong beliefs about the domain.

Requirements-driven incremental adoption of variability management techniques and tools: an industrial experience report,,"Institute for Software Technology, University of Koblenz–Landau, Universitätsstraße 1, 56070, Koblenz, Germany",29-Sep-13,"AbstractIn theory, software product line engineering has reached a mature state. In practice though, implementing a variability management approach remains a tough case-by-case challenge for any organization. To tame the complexity of this undertaking, it is inevitable to handle variability from multiple perspectives and to manage variability consistently across artifacts, tools, and workflows. Especially, a solid understanding and management of the requirements to be met by the products is an inevitable prerequisite. In this article, we share experiences from the ongoing incremental adoption of explicit variability management at TRW Automotive’s department for automotive slip control systems—located in Koblenz, Germany. On the technical side, the three key drivers of this adoption effort are (a) domain modeling and scoping, (b) handling of variability in requirements and (c) tighter integration of software engineering focus areas (e.g., domain modeling, requirements engineering, architectural modeling) to make use of variability-related data. In addition to implementation challenges with using and integrating concrete third-party tools, social and workflow-related issues are covered as well.

On the systematic transformation of requirements to specifications,,"College of Computer Science and Information Technology, Guangxi Normal University, No. 15 Yu Cai Road, Guilin, 541004, Guangxi, People’s Republic of China",16-Jun-13,"AbstractFormal approaches to development are widely acknowledged to have difficulty in the validation of real-world requirements; in contrast, non-formal approaches find it difficult to identify the formal structures in requirements that are useful in a solution. That the problems that computing treats are embedded in the real world with solutions being an essentially formal machine means this dichotomy will always exist, with some new approach to the development needed which can draw a boundary between what is formalised and what can be left informal. In this paper, we show how the natural cause-and-effect structures that can be found in non-formal requirements descriptions can be used systematically to arrive at a software specification. The theoretical contribution of the work is the formalisation of Jackson’s idea of problem progression in his Problem Frames framework through the use of a graph grammar to capture problem models as graphs and their manipulation as transformations. The approach is illustrated through a substantial benchmark example—Swartout’s and Balzer’s package router.

"Eddy, a formal language for specifying and analyzing data flow specifications for conflicting privacy requirements",,"Institute for Software Research, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",18-Dec-13,"AbstractIncreasingly, companies use multi-source data to operate new information systems, such as social networking, e-commerce, and location-based services. These systems leverage complex, multi-stakeholder data supply chains in which each stakeholder (e.g., users, developers, companies, and government) must manage privacy and security requirements that cover their practices. US regulator and European regulator expect companies to ensure consistency between their privacy policies and their data practices, including restrictions on what data may be collected, how it may be used, to whom it may be transferred, and for what purposes. To help developers check consistency, we identified a strict subset of commonly found privacy requirements and we developed a methodology to map these requirements from natural language text to a formal language in description logic, called Eddy. Using this language, developers can detect conflicting privacy requirements within a policy and enable the tracing of data flows within these policies. We derived our methodology from an exploratory case study of the Facebook platform policy and an extended case study using privacy policies from Zynga and AOL Advertising. In this paper, we report results from multiple analysts in a literal replication study, which includes a refined methodology and set of heuristics that we used to extract privacy requirements from policy texts.

On requirement verification for evolving Statecharts specifications,,"DeepSE Research Group, Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy",27-Dec-13,"AbstractSoftware 
development processes have been evolving from rigid, pre-specified, and sequential to incremental, and iterative. This evolution has been dictated by the need to accommodate evolving user requirements and reduce the delay between design decision and feedback from users. Formal verification techniques, however, have largely ignored this evolution and even when they made enormous improvements and found significant uses in practice, like in the case of model checking, they remained confined into the niches of safety-critical systems. Model checking verifies if a system’s model \(\mathcal{M}\) satisfies a set of requirements, formalized as a set of logic properties \(\Phi\). Current model-checking approaches, however, implicitly rely on the assumption that both the complete model \(\mathcal{M}\) and the whole set of properties \(\Phi\) are fully specified when verification takes place. Very often, however, \(\mathcal{M}\) is subject to change because its development is iterative and its definition evolves through stages of incompleteness, where alternative design decisions are explored, typically to evaluate some quality trade-offs. Evolving systems specifications of this kind ask for novel verification approaches that tolerate incompleteness and support incremental analysis of alternative designs for certain functionalities. This is exactly the focus of this paper, which develops an incremental model-checking approach for evolving Statecharts. Statecharts have been chosen both because they are increasingly used in practice natively support model refinements.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0198-z,,"['Software modeling', 'Statecharts', 'Agile development', 'Formal verification', 'Model checking', 'Incremental verification']",9Citations,Springer,,Carlo Ghezzi,Claudio Menghi,Amir Molzam Sharifloo,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0198-z,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Visual requirements analytics: a framework and case study,,"Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA",27-Nov-13,"AbstractFor many software projects, keeping requirements on track needs an effective and efficient path from data to decision. Visual analytics creates such a path that enables the human to extract insights by interacting with the relevant information. While various requirements visualization techniques exist, few have produced end-to-end value to practitioners. In this paper, we advance the literature on visual requirements analytics by characterizing its key components and relationships in a framework. We follow the goal–question–metric paradigm to define the framework by teasing out five conceptual goals (user, data, model, visualization, and knowledge), their specific operationalizations, and their interconnections. The framework allows us to not only assess existing approaches, but also create tool enhancements in a principled manner. We evaluate our enhanced tool support through a case study where massive, heterogeneous, and dynamic requirements are processed, visualized, and analyzed. Working together with practitioners on a contemporary software project within its real-life context leads to the main finding that visual analytics can help tackle both open-ended visual exploration tasks and well-structured visual exploitation tasks in requirements engineering. In addition, the study helps the practitioners to reach actionable decisions in a wide range of areas relating to their project, ranging from theme and outlier identification, over requirements tracing, to risk assessment. Overall, our work illuminates how the data-to-decision analytical capabilities could be improved by the increased interactivity of requirements visualization.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0194-3,,"['Requirements management', 'Visual analytics', 'Requirements engineering visualization', 'Visual analytical reasoning', 'Exploratory case study', 'Risk assessment']",33Citations,Springer,,Sandeep Reddivari,Shirin Rad,Tanmay Bhowmik,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0194-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Supporting requirements to code traceability through refactoring,,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, 39762, USA",23-Dec-13,"AbstractIn this paper, we hypothesize that the distorted traceability tracks of a software system can be systematically re-established through refactoring, a set of behavior-preserving transformations for keeping the system quality under control during evolution. To test our hypothesis, we conduct an experimental analysis using three requirements-to-code datasets from various application domains. Our objective is to assess the impact of various refactoring methods on the performance of automated tracing tools based on information retrieval. Results show that renaming inconsistently named code identifiers, using Rename Identifier refactoring, often leads to improvements in traceability. In contrast, removing code clones, using eXtract Method (XM) refactoring, is found to be detrimental. In addition, results show that moving misplaced code fragments, using Move Method refactoring, has no significant impact on trace link retrieval. We further evaluate Rename Identifier refactoring by comparing its performance with other strategies often used to overcome the vocabulary mismatch problem in software artifacts. In addition, we propose and evaluate various techniques to mitigate the negative impact of XM refactoring. An effective traceability sign analysis is also conducted to quantify the effect of these refactoring methods on the vocabulary structure of software systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0197-0,,"['Information retrieval', 'Traceability', 'Refactoring']",24Citations,Springer,,Anas Mahmoud,Nan Niu,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0197-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
The role of domain knowledge in requirements elicitation via interviews: an exploratory study,,"Department of Information Systems, University of Haifa, Carmel Mount., 31905, Haifa, Israel",23-Sep-12,"AbstractRequirements elicitation is the first activity in the requirements engineering process. It includes learning, surfacing, and discovering the requirements of the stakeholders of the developed system. Various elicitation techniques exist to help analysts elicit the requirements from the different stakeholders; the most commonly used technique is the interview. Analysts may have domain knowledge prior to the elicitation process. Such knowledge is commonly assumed to have positive effects on requirements engineering processes, in that it fosters communication, and a mutual understanding of the needs. However, to a minor extent, some negative effects have also been reported. This paper presents an empirical study in which the perceived and actual effects of prior domain knowledge on requirements elicitation via interviews were examined. The results indicate that domain knowledge affects elicitation via interview in two main aspects: communication with the customers and understanding their needs. The findings provide insights as to both the positive and negative effects of domain knowledge on requirements elicitation via interview, as perceived by participants with and without domain knowledge, and show the existence of an actual effect on the course of the interviews. Furthermore, these insights can be utilized in practice to support analysts in the elicitation process and to form requirements analysis teams. They highlight the different contributions that can be provided by analysts with different levels of domain knowledge in requirements analysis teams and the synergy that can be gained by forming heterogeneous teams of analysts.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0163-2,,"['Requirements elicitation', 'Interview', 'Domain knowledge', 'Empirical study']",78Citations,Springer,,Irit Hadar,Pnina Soffer,Keren Kenzi,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-012-0163-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Dynamic decision models for staged software product line configuration,,"Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada",09-Feb-13,"AbstractSoftware product line engineering practices offer desirable characteristics such as rapid product development, reduced time-to-market, and more affordable development costs as a result of systematic representation of the variabilities of a domain of discourse that leads to methodical reuse of software assets. The development lifecycle of a product line consists of two main phases: domain engineering, which deals with the understanding and formally modeling of the target domain, and application engineering that is concerned with the configuration of a product line into one concrete product based on the preferences and requirements of the stakeholders. The work presented in this paper focuses on the application engineering phase and builds both the theoretical and technological tools to assist the stakeholders in (a) understanding the complex interactions of the features of a product line; (b) eliciting the utility of each feature for the stakeholders and hence exposing the stakeholders’ otherwise implicit preferences in a way that they can more easily make decisions; and (c) dynamically building a decision model through interaction with the stakeholders and by considering the structural characteristics of software product line feature models, which will guide the stakeholders through the product configuration process. Initial exploratory empirical experiments that we have performed show that our proposed approach for helping stakeholders understand their feature preferences and its associated staged feature model configuration process is able to positively impact the quality of the end results of the application engineering process within the context of the limited number of participants. In addition, it has been observed that the offered tooling support is able to ease the staged feature model configuration process.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0165-8,,"['Software product lines', 'Feature models', 'Utility elicitation', 'Stakeholder preferences']",19Citations,Springer,,Ebrahim Bagheri,Faezeh Ensan,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0165-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

At the same time, as the economy and society move toward globalization, more organizations shift to distributed development of software projects. From this perspective, while adopting agile techniques seems beneficial, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed; among these notable is the effective cooperation between the stakeholders and the geographically distributed development team. In addition, data collection and validation for requirements engineering demands efficient processing techniques in order to handle the volume of data as well as to manage different inconsistencies, when the data are collected using online tools.

A requirements data model for product service systems,,"Chair for Information Systems, Technische Universität München (TUM), Boltzmannstr. 3, 85748, Garching, Germany",17-Oct-12,"AbstractProduct service systems (PSS) are bundles of physical technological elements and service elements that are integrated to solve customer problems. In practice, most components of PSS are developed independently from each other, which leads to problems with coordination of development activities and integration of PSS components. Therefore, an integrated requirements engineering for PSS is needed that deals with the involvement of developers from product engineering, software engineering, and service engineering, as well as the inherent complexity of the PSS and the development process. In a case study with the development department of a PSS provider, we analyzed requirements documents and conducted expert interviews. We identified problems in the development, for example, that requirements on different levels of abstraction are intermingled, rationales for requirements are missing, and the concretization of requirements is unclear. To solve these problems, we propose a requirements data model (RDMod) for requirements to PSS. An RDMod describes different types of requirements and the relations between them. Thus, it is a scheme for the concretization of the requirements, which especially addresses the problems of structuring the requirements, enabling traceability, and finding conflicts. We then used an analytical evaluation, a feature-based evaluation and a retrospective application with requirements analysts of the industry partner. In a joint workshop, we specified requirements for a PSS with the RDMod. In structured interviews, we analyzed the perceived advantages of the RDMod. The experts confirmed that the RDMod is applicable in their development and it provides a clear structure for the requirements and therefore helps overcoming the identified problems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0164-1,available,"['Requirements engineering', 'Requirements data model', 'Artifact model', 'Product service systems', 'PSS', 'Hybrid products', 'Requirements concretization']",44Citations,Springer,,Marina Berkovich,Jan Marco Leimeister,Axel Hoffmann,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-012-0164-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

All patterns are based on empirical evidence we gathered in case studies. Additionally, they are validated through a systematic literature review. Based on the time patterns, we then provide an in-depth evaluation of selected PAISs and academic approaches. Altogether, the 10 time patterns will not only facilitate the selection of technologies for realizing time- and process-aware information systems but can also be used as reference for implementing time support in PAISs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0162-3,,"['Process-aware information system', 'Workflow patterns', 'Time patterns', 'Temporal perspective']",58Citations,Springer,,Andreas Lanz,Barbara Weber,Manfred Reichert,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-012-0162-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Delphi technique is the methodology employed in order to analyze the degree of these factors in Iranian electronic banking users. All the four above-mentioned factors, as the websites qualitative parameters, were true about Iran banks, too. Nevertheless, there was no agreement of the way of attracting the customers to security issues. Iranian banks can set these parameters as their pattern in order to reduce the expenses of lost opportunities and improve the quality of their own website services.

Box 14100, 00076, Aalto, Espoo, Finland",25-Apr-12,"AbstractRequirement development activities such as requirements analysis and modelling are well defined in software engineering. A model-based requirement development may result in significant improvements in engineering design. In current product development activities in this domain, not all requirements are consciously identified and modelled. This paper presents the checklist-oriented requirements analysis modelling (CORAMOD) approach. CORAMOD is a methodology for the use of model-based systems engineering for requirements analysis of complex products utilizing checklists, the simplest kind of rational design method. The model-based focuses the requirements analysis process on requirement modelling, whereas the checklist encourages a conscious and systematic approach to identify requirements. We illustrate the utility of CORAMOD artefacts by a comprehensive case study example and modelling with system modelling language (SysML). We suggest that visual accessibility of the SysML views facilitates the full participation of all stakeholders and enables the necessary dialogue and negotiation.

Guidelines for using UML association classes and their effect on domain understanding in requirements engineering,,"Saint Louis University, St. Louis, MO, USA",26-Jul-12,"AbstractThe analysis and description of the application domain are important parts of the requirements engineering process. Domain descriptions are frequently represented as models in the de-facto standard unified modeling language (UML). Recent research has specified the semantics of various UML language elements for domain modeling, based on ontological considerations. In this paper, we empirically examine ontological modeling guidelines for the UML association construct, which plays a central role in UML class diagrams. Using an experimental study, we find that some, but not all, of the proposed guidelines lead to better application domain models. We use a process-tracing study to investigate in more detail the effects of ontological guidelines. The combined results indicate that ontological guidelines can improve the usefulness of UML class diagrams for describing the application domain, and thus have the potential to improve downstream system development activities and ultimately affect the successful information systems implementation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0159-y,,"['UML association class', 'Conceptual model', 'Domain understanding']",10Citations,Springer,,Palash Bera,Joerg Evermann,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-012-0159-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
System requirements engineering in complex situations,,"Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering, National Centers for System of Systems Engineering, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA",21-Jun-12,"AbstractThe purpose of this paper is to present an alternative systems thinking–based perspective and approach to the requirements elicitation process in complex situations. Three broad challenges associated with the requirements engineering elicitation in complex situations are explored, including the (1) role of the system observer, (2) nature of system requirements in complex situations, and (3) influence of the system environment. Authors have asserted that the expectation of unambiguous, consistent, complete, understandable, verifiable, traceable, and modifiable requirements is not consistent with complex situations. In contrast, complex situations are an emerging design reality for requirements engineering processes, marked by high levels of ambiguity, uncertainty, and emergence. This paper develops the argument that dealing with requirements for complex situations requires a change in paradigm. The elicitation of requirements for simple and technically driven systems is appropriately accomplished by proven methods. In contrast, the elicitation of requirements in complex situations (e.g., integrated multiple critical infrastructures, system-of-systems, etc.) requires more holistic thinking and can be enhanced by grounding in systems theory.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0157-0,,"['Complex situation', 'Requirements elicitation', 'System complexity', 'Systems theory', 'Systems thinking']",44Citations,Springer,,Polinpapilinho F.

Comparing the impact of the OO-DFD and the Use Case methods for modeling functional requirements on comprehension and quality of models: a controlled experiment,,"Department of Information Systems Engineering, Ben-Gurion University, 84105, Beer-Sheva, Israel",31-May-12,"AbstractUsers’ requirements of an information system are modeled in the analysis phase of the development process. The requirements can be modeled with various modeling methods. In this study, we compare two alternative methods for modeling the functional requirements: one is the UML Use Case (UC) model; the other is OO-DFD transaction (Object-Oriented DFD is a variant of DFD that includes data classes rather than “traditional” data stores). Each of these modeling methods consists of diagrams accompanied with narrative, semi-structured descriptions explaining their details. We conducted a controlled experiment that compared the comprehension of the two models (i.e., the diagrams and their descriptions) of a certain system and the quality of models created for a certain system with each of the two modeling methods. The main results of the experiment are that models created with the UC method are of better quality than models created with the OO-DFD transaction method because the former are simpler and less detailed; creating highly detailed models are error prone. Interestingly, in spite of the difference in the level of detail and structure, the experiment reveals no significant difference in comprehension of models of the two methods. The results call for improvement of the modeling methods in a way that considers the advantages of each of them, and thus we propose an improved method sketch that we call Enhanced Use Case, which will be evaluated in future work.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0155-2,,"['Functional analysis', 'IS development', 'Modeling methods', 'User requirements', 'Use Case', 'UML', 'FOOM', 'OO-DFD']",7Citations,Springer,,Michal Dahan,Peretz Shoval,Arnon Sturm,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-012-0155-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Moreover, the standard demands consideration of laws and regulations, as well as privacy concerns. These demands present multi-disciplinary challenges for security engineers. Cloud computing provides scalable IT resources and the challenges of establishing an ISMS increases, because of the significant number of stakeholders and technologies involved and the distribution of clouds among many countries. We analyzed the ISO 27001 demands for these multi-disciplinary challenges and cloud computing systems. Based on these insights, we provide a method that relies upon existing requirements engineering methods and patterns for several security tasks, e.g., context descriptions, threat analysis and policy definition.

A framework for enabling trust requirements in social cloud applications,,"Network Information and Computer Security Lab, University of Malaga, Málaga, Spain",28-Apr-13,"AbstractCloud applications entail the provision of a huge amount of heterogeneous, geographically distributed resources managed and shared by many different stakeholders who often do not know each other beforehand. This raises numerous security concerns that, if not addressed carefully, might hinder the adoption of this promising computational model. Appropriately dealing with these threats gains special relevance in the social cloud context, where computational resources are provided by the users themselves. We argue that taking trust and reputation requirements into account can leverage security in these scenarios by incorporating the notions of trust relationships and reputation into them.

Evaluating cloud deployment scenarios based on security and privacy requirements,,"Department of Cultural Technology and Communication, University of the Aegean, University Hill, 81100, Mytilene, Greece",04-Apr-13,"AbstractMigrating organisational services, data and application on the Cloud is an important strategic decision for organisations due to the large number of benefits introduced by the usage of cloud computing, such as cost reduction and on-demand resources. Despite, however, many benefits, there are challenges and risks for cloud adaption related to (amongst others) data leakage, insecure APIs and shared technology vulnerabilities. These challenges need to be understood and analysed in the context of an organisation’s security and privacy goals and relevant cloud computing deployment models. Although the literature provides a large number of references to works that consider cloud computing security issues, no work has been provided, to our knowledge, which supports the elicitation of security and privacy requirements and the selection of an appropriate cloud deployment model based on such requirements. This work contributes towards this gap. In particular, we propose a requirements engineering framework to support the elicitation of security and privacy requirements and the selection of an appropriate deployment model based on the elicited requirements.

Effect of personality type on structured tool comprehension performance,,"ICFAI Business School, Hyderabad, India",12-Jul-12,"AbstractAccurate understanding of software requirements by end users and software developers is important to ensure a high quality software product. While comprehension performance on systems analysis tools has been studied in the past, there is little research that examined the influence of personality type of an individual on his/her performance. This paper has two objectives. First, the research uncovers the relationships between personality types (introvert/extrovert, sensing/intuitive, feeling/thinking, and perceptive/judging) and comprehension performance (accuracy and speed) of users/developers using the structured tools: Decision Tables (DT), Nassi–Schneiderman Charts (NS) and Structured English (SE). Second, it examines the trade-offs between comprehension accuracy and speed for each personality type. Using laboratory experiments, we measured individual performance with the three structured tools. We found that introverts and feeling personalities comprehended more accurately with DT; thinking and intuitive personalities comprehended more accurately with NS and SE. The comprehension accuracy increased with time more for SE than for DT and NS. The results show the most suitable combinations of structured tools and personality types for high comprehension. The results also provide guidelines to managers with tight project schedules, such as structured tools that are easier/faster to understand and the matching personalities who can comprehend faster.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0158-z,,"['Structured tools', 'Personality type', 'Comprehension accuracy', 'Comprehension speed', 'Systems analysis']",4Citations,Springer,,Narasimhaiah Gorla,Ananth Chiravuri,Peter Meso,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-012-0158-z,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Comparison and evaluation of goal-oriented satisfaction analysis techniques,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada",06-Jan-12,"AbstractGoal-oriented requirements engineering (GORE) has been introduced as a means of modeling and understanding the motivations for system requirements. Using models to make goals explicit helps to avoid system failures due to implementing the wrong requirements or ignoring certain stakeholder needs. These models are unique when compared to other models used in system analysis in that their structure naturally lends itself to an analysis of goal satisfaction. Existing work claims that analysis using goal models can facilitate decision making over functional or design alternatives, using criteria in the model. Many different approaches to the analysis of goal-oriented requirements models have been proposed, including several procedures that analyze the satisfaction or denial of goals. These procedures make different choices in their interpretation of the goal model syntax, the methods to resolve conflicting or partial evidence, and in the way they represent satisfaction. This work uses three available tools implementing seven similar goal satisfaction analysis procedures to analyze three sample goal models. Results are reported and compared. The purpose of this comparison is to understand the ways in which procedural design choices affect analysis results, and how differences in analysis results could lead to different recommendations over alternatives in the model. Our comparison shows that different satisfaction analysis techniques for goal models can produce variable results, depending on the structure of the model. Comparison findings lead us to recommend the use of satisfaction analysis techniques for goal models as only heuristics for decision making. Our results emphasize investigation into the benefits of satisfaction analysis beyond decision making, namely improving model quality, increasing domain knowledge, and facilitating communication.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0143-y,,"['Goal-oriented requirements engineering', 'Requirements modeling', 'Model analysis']",98Citations,Springer,,Jennifer Horkoff,Eric Yu,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-011-0143-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Quantifying the impact of requirements definition and management process maturity on project outcome in large business application development,,"Department of Computing, Lancaster University, LA1 4WA, Lancaster, UK",12-Feb-12,"AbstractUsing data from two surveys of people knowledgeable about requirements for, and the success of the development of, large commercial applications (CAs) in hundreds of large organizations from around the world, this paper reports a high positive correlation between an organization’s requirements definition and management (RDM) maturity and that organization’s successful performance on CA development projects. Among the organizations that responded with a filled survey, an organization that is assessed at a high RDM maturity is significantly more successful in its CA development projects than is an organization that is assessed at a low RDM maturity, when success in CA development projects is measured as (1) delivering CAs on-time, on-budget, and on-function, (2) meeting the business objectives of these projects, and (3) the perceived success of these projects. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for RDM, describes a quality RDM process, and describes RDM maturity and how to measure it. It describes the two surveys, the first of which ended up being a pilot for the second, which was designed taking into account what was learned from the first survey.

Managing requirements uncertainty with partial models,,"University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada",25-Apr-13,"AbstractModels are good at expressing information that is known but do not typically have support for representing what information a modeler does not know at a particular phase in the software development process. Partial models address this by being able to precisely represent uncertainty about model content. In previous work, we developed a general approach for defining partial models and using them to reason about design models containing uncertainty. In this paper, we show how to apply our approach to managing uncertainty in requirements by providing support for uncertainty capture, elaboration, and change. In particular, we address the problem of specifying uncertainty within a requirements model, refining a model as uncertainty reduces, providing meaning to traceability relations between models containing uncertainty, and propagating uncertainty-reducing changes between related models. We describe the implementation of uncertainty management within the Model Management Tool Framework and illustrate our approach using two examples.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0170-y,,"['Uncertainty', 'i* models', 'Partial models', 'Automation']",38Citations,Springer,,Rick Salay,Marsha Chechik,Jennifer Horkoff,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0170-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A cross-domain empirical study and legal evaluation of the requirements water marking method,,"Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",04-Apr-13,"AbstractCompanies that own, license, or maintain personal information face a daunting number of privacy and security regulations. Companies are subject to new regulations from one or more governing bodies, when companies introduce new or existing products into a jurisdiction, when regulations change, or when data are transferred across political borders. To address this problem, we developed a framework called “requirements water marking” that business analysts can use to align and reconcile requirements from multiple jurisdictions (municipalities, provinces, nations) to produce a single high or low standard of care. We evaluate the framework in two empirical case studies covering a subset of U.S. data breach notification laws and medical record retention laws. In these studies, applying our framework reduced the number of requirements a company must comply with by 76 % across 8 jurisdictions and 15 % across 4 jurisdictions, respectively. We show how the framework surfaces critical requirements trade-offs and potential regulatory conflicts that companies must address during the reconciliation process.

Assessing requirements-related risks through probabilistic goals and obstacles,,"Département d’Ingénierie Informatique, Université catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium",25-May-13,"AbstractRequirements completeness is among the most critical and difficult software engineering challenges. Missing requirements often result from poor risk analysis at requirements engineering time. Obstacle analysis is a goal-oriented form of risk analysis aimed at anticipating exceptional conditions in which the software should behave adequately. In the identify-assess-control cycles of such analysis, the assessment step is not well supported by existing techniques. This step is concerned with evaluating how likely the obstacles to goals are and how likely and severe their consequences are. Those key factors drive the selection of most appropriate countermeasures to be integrated in the system goal model for increased completeness. Moreover, obstacles to probabilistic goals are currently not supported; such goals prescribe that some corresponding target property should be satisfied in at least X % of the cases. The paper presents a probabilistic framework for goal specification and obstacle assessment. The specification language for goals and obstacles is extended with a probabilistic layer where probabilities have a precise semantics grounded on system-specific phenomena. The probability of a root obstacle to a goal is thereby computed by up-propagation of probabilities of finer-grained obstacles through the obstacle refinement tree. The probability and severity of obstacle consequences is in turn computed by up-propagation from the obstructed leaf goals through the goal refinement graph. The paper shows how the computed information can be used to prioritize obstacles for countermeasure selection toward a more complete and robust goal model. A detailed evaluation of our framework on a non-trivial carpooling support system is also reported.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-013-0168-5,,"['Obstacle analysis', 'Risk assessment', 'Probabilistic goals', 'Requirements completeness', 'Goal-oriented requirements engineering', 'Risk analysis', 'Quantitative reasoning']",29Citations,Springer,,Antoine Cailliau,Axel van Lamsweerde,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-013-0168-5,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Features meet scenarios: modeling and consistency-checking scenario-based product line specifications,,"Dependable Evolvable Pervasive Software Engineering, Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy",16-Apr-13,"AbstractMany modern software-intensive systems consist of multiple components interacting together to deliver the intended functionality. Often, these systems come in many variants (products) and are managed together as a software product line. This variability is the source of additional complexity which can cause inconsistencies and offset the economies of scale promised by product line engineering. Engineers thus need intuitive, yet precise means for specifying requirements and require tools for automatically detecting inconsistencies within these requirements. In recent work, we proposed a technique for the scenario-based specification of interactions in product lines by a combination of Modal Sequence Diagrams and Feature Diagrams. Furthermore, we elaborated an efficient consistency-checking technique based on a dedicated model-checking approach especially tailored for product lines. In this paper, we report on further evaluations that underline significant performance benefits of our approach.

Uncovering quality-attribute concerns in use case specifications via early aspect mining,,"ISISTAN Research Institute, UNICEN University, Paraje Arroyo Seco, Tandil, Argentina",21-Dec-11,"AbstractQuality-attribute requirements describe constraints on the development and behavior of a software system, and their satisfaction is key for the success of a software project. Detecting and analyzing quality attributes in early development stages provides insights for system design, reduces risks, and ultimately improves the developers’ understanding of the system. A common problem, however, is that quality-attribute information tends to be understated in requirements specifications and scattered across several documents. Thus, making the quality attributes first-class citizens becomes usually a time-consuming task for analysts. Recent developments have made it possible to mine concerns semi-automatically from textual documents. Leveraging on these ideas, we present a semi-automated approach to identify latent quality attributes that works in two stages. First, a mining tool extracts early aspects from use cases, and then these aspects are processed to derive candidate quality attributes. This derivation is based on an ontology of quality-attribute scenarios. We have built a prototype tool called QAMiner to implement our approach. The evaluation of this tool in two case studies from the literature has shown interesting results. As main contribution, we argue that our approach can help analysts to skim requirements documents and quickly produce a list of potential quality attributes for the system.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0142-z,,"['Quality attribute', 'Early aspect', 'Use case specification', 'Text mining', 'Tool support']",16Citations,Springer,,Alejandro Rago,Claudia Marcos,J.

We present some indicators for measuring quality in textual requirements, as well as a tool that computes quality measures in a fully automated way. We want to emphasize that the final goal must be measure to improve. Reducing quality management to the acquisition of a numerical evaluation would crash against the strong opposition of requirements engineers themselves, who would not see in the measurement process the aid of a counselor, but a policeman mechanism of penalties. To avoid this, quality indicators must first of all point out concrete defects and provide suggestions for improvement. The final result will not only be an improvement in the quality of requirements, but also an improvement in the writing skills of requirements engineers.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0134-z,,"['Requirements quality', 'Quality properties', 'Quality indicators', 'Quality metrics', 'Quality measurement tool', 'Natural language processing']",75Citations,Springer,,Gonzalo Génova,José M.

Uni-REPM: validated and improved,,"Blekinge Institute of Technology, 371 79, Karlskrona, Sweden",01-Mar-12,"Abstract Software products are usually developed for either a specific customer (bespoke) or a broader market (market-driven). Due to their characteristic, bespoke and market-driven development face different challenges, especially concerning requirements engineering. Many challenges are caused by an inadequate requirements engineering process, and hence there is a need for process improvement frameworks based on empirical research and industry needs. In a previous article we introduced Uni-REPM, a lightweight requirements engineering process assessment framework based on a review of empirically motivated practices in market-driven and bespoke requirements engineering literature. In this article, we validate this framework in academia as well as industry, in order to prepare Uni-REPM for widespread industry use. We conduct two validations; a static validation based on interviews with seven academic experts and a dynamic validation where Uni-REPM is applied in four industrial organisations. Uni-REPM is refined according to the feedback obtained in the validations. The study shows that Uni-REPM is a quick, simple, and cost-effective solution to assess the maturity level of the requirements engineering process of projects.

Adaptive socio-technical systems: a requirements-based approach,,"Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, Università degli Studi di Trento, Via Sommarive, 14, 38123, Povo, TN, Italy",22-Sep-11,"AbstractA socio-technical system (STS) consists of an interplay of humans, organizations, and technical systems. STSs are heterogeneous, dynamic, unpredictable, and weakly controllable. Their operational environment changes unexpectedly, actors join and leave the system at will, actors fail to meet their objectives and under-perform, and dependencies on other actors are violated. To deal with such situations, we propose an architecture for STSs that makes an STS self-reconfigurable, i.e., capable of switching autonomously from one configuration to a better one. Our architecture performs a Monitor-Diagnose-Reconcile-Compensate cycle: it monitors actor behaviors and context changes, diagnoses failures and under-performance by checking whether monitored behavior is compliant with actors goals, finds a possible way to address the problem, and enacts compensation actions to reconcile actual and desired behavior. Compensation actions take into account the autonomy of participants in an STS, which cannot be controlled. Our architecture is requirements driven: we use extended Tropos goal models to diagnose failures as well as to identify alternative strategies to meet requirements. After presenting our conceptual architecture and the algorithms, it is founded upon; we describe a prototype implementation applied to a case study concerning smart-homes. We also provide experimental results that suggest that our architecture scales well as the size of the STS grows.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0132-1,,"['Self-adaptive software', 'Socio-technical systems', 'Goal models', 'Requirements engineering']",90Citations,Springer,,Fabiano Dalpiaz,Paolo Giorgini,John Mylopoulos,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-011-0132-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

An integrated strategy to systematically understand and manage quality in use for web applications,,"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China",13-Aug-11,"AbstractThe main goal in evaluating software quality is to ultimately improve its quality. In this work, we discuss SIQinU (Strategy for Improving Quality in Use), a six-phased evaluation-driven strategy for understanding and improving software quality requirements in a systematic way. Starting with quality in use (QinU), we design specific user tasks and context of use, and through identifying problems in QinU, we determine external quality (EQ) attributes that could be related to these QinU weakly performing indicators. Then, after deriving EQ attributes related to the QinU problems, we evaluate EQ and derive a benchmark to be used as a basis to make improvements. Once improvement recommendations are made based on poorly performing EQ indicators, a new version of the software application is completed and evaluated again for its EQ to establish a delta from the initial benchmark. Then, we re-evaluate QinU to determine the improvements resulting in QinU from the improvements made at the EQ level, thus leading to a cyclic strategy for improvement and development of relationships. SIQinU is a repeatable and consistent strategy which relies on: a conceptual framework (with ontological base), a process, and specific methods.

Comparing task practicing and prototype fidelities when applying scenario acting to elicit requirements,,"University of Iceland, Dunhaga 5, 107, Reykjavik, Iceland",13-Aug-11,"AbstractIdentifying accurate user requirements early in the design cycle is of the utmost importance in system development. The purpose of this study of requirements elicitation was to compare the results of involving the user early in the design cycle using a low-fidelity prototype with the results of involving the user after a high-fidelity prototype was available. Three groups of potential users applied the method of Scenario Acting. Participants in the first group were given a working prototype of a human capital development system. The participants of the second group were given a detailed description of proposed features of the system and were told to practice on a paper prototype or with current methods, such as an Internet browser. These groups then practiced the tasks for some time before participating in the Scenario Acting. The third group received a brief description of the objectives of the system and did not practice the tasks. The results of the study showed that the use of the high-fidelity prototype was not helpful for eliciting requirements when working with users. However, the second group, taking time to practice the tasks given a low-fidelity paper prototype outperformed the others. Furthermore, the analysis of the Scenario Acting sessions revealed that two sessions were better than one, especially for participants of the group working with a low-fidelity prototype. An analysis of the topic of requirements showed that there was no difference between the groups on the domain tasks (here, human capital development), but the group practicing on the high-fidelity prototype commented more on its ease of use and usefulness than the other two.

Exploring the impact of software requirements on system-wide goals: a method using satisfaction arguments and i* goal modelling,,"Centre for Human–Computer Interaction Design, City University London, London, EC1V 0HB, UK",16-Nov-11,"AbstractThis paper describes the application of requirements engineering concepts to support the analysis of the impact of new software systems on system-wide goals. Requirements on a new or revised software component of a socio-technical system not only have implications on the goals of the subsystem itself, but they also impact upon the goals of the existing integrated system. In industries such as air traffic management and healthcare, impacts need to be identified and demonstrated in order to assess concerns such as risk, safety, and accuracy. A method called PiLGRIM was developed which integrates means-end relationships within goal modelling with knowledge associated with the application domain. The relationship between domain knowledge and requirements, as described in a satisfaction argument, adds traceability rationale to help determine the impacts of new requirements across a network of heterogeneous actors. We report procedures that human analysts follow to use the concepts of satisfaction arguments in a software tool for i* goal modelling. Results were demonstrated using models and arguments developed in two case studies, each featuring a distinct socio-technical system—a new controlled airspace infringement detection tool for NATS (the UK’s air navigation service provider), and a new version of the UK’s HIV/AIDS patient reporting system. Results provided evidence towards our claims that the conceptual integration of i* and satisfaction arguments is usable and useful to human analysts, and that the PiLGRIM impact analysis procedures and tool support are effective and scalable to model and analyse large and complex socio-technical systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0138-8,,"['\ni* Modelling', 'Satisfaction argument', 'Impact analysis', 'Requirements process']",13Citations,Springer,,James Lockerbie,Neil Arthur McDougall Maiden,Jorgen Engmann,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-011-0138-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Towards an understanding of the causes and effects of software requirements change: two case studies,,"School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queens University Belfast, Belfast, UK",09-May-12,"AbstractChanges to software requirements not only pose a risk to the successful delivery of software applications but also provide opportunity for improved usability and value. Increased understanding of the causes and consequences of change can support requirements management and also make progress towards the goal of change anticipation. This paper presents the results of two case studies that address objectives arising from that ultimate goal. The first case study evaluated the potential of a change source taxonomy containing the elements ‘market’, ‘organisation’, ‘vision’, ‘specification’, and ‘solution’ to provide a meaningful basis for change classification and measurement. The second case study investigated whether the requirements attributes of novelty, complexity, and dependency correlated with requirements volatility. While insufficiency of data in the first case study precluded an investigation of changes arising due to the change source of ‘market’, for the remainder of the change sources, results indicate a significant difference in cost, value to the customer and management considerations. Findings show that higher cost and value changes arose more often from ‘organisation’ and ‘vision’ sources; these changes also generally involved the co-operation of more stakeholder groups and were considered to be less controllable than changes arising from the ‘specification’ or ‘solution’ sources. Results from the second case study indicate that only ‘requirements dependency’ is consistently correlated with volatility and that changes coming from each change source affect different groups of requirements. We conclude that the taxonomy can provide a meaningful means of change classification, but that a single requirement attribute is insufficient for change prediction. A theoretical causal account of requirements change is drawn from the implications of the combined results of the two case studies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0149-0,available,"['Requirements change', 'Requirements evolution', 'Requirements volatility', 'Collaborative case study']",29Citations,Springer,,Sharon McGee,Des Greer,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-012-0149-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Power and politics in requirements engineering: embracing the dark side?,,"Centre for Human-Computer Interaction Design, City University London, London, EC1V 0HB, UK",25-Apr-12,"AbstractThis paper considers the role of power and politics in requirements engineering (RE). It presents a brief working definition of both terms and provides an overview of existing literature both in RE and related disciplines. It argues that, given the increased complexity, uncertainty, and organisational embeddedness faced by RE in practice, power and politics have necessarily become increasingly relevant factors, but that they have not yet been given adequate consideration. A framework for analysis is presented, examining power and politics in turn through the structure of power relations and the process of decision-making. This framework is explored by applying it to a case study of a website development in a publishing company. The use of a case study is intended to demonstrate the proposed framework, perform an initial validation of it, and an assessment of its utility to RE.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0151-6,,"['Power', 'Politics', 'Requirements engineering', 'Stakeholders', 'Decision-making', 'Case study']",41Citations,Springer,,Alastair Milne,Neil Maiden,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-012-0151-6,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A legal cross-references taxonomy for reasoning about compliance requirements,,"Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA",29-Apr-12,"AbstractCompanies must ensure their software complies with relevant laws and regulations to avoid the risk of costly penalties, lost reputation, and brand damage resulting from non-compliance. Laws and regulations contain internal cross-references to portions of the same legal text, as well as cross-references to external legal texts. These cross-references introduce ambiguities, exceptions, as well as other challenges to regulatory compliance. Requirements engineers need guidance as to how to address cross-references in order to comply with the requirements of the law. Herein, we analyze each external cross-reference within the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), and the GLBA Financial Privacy Rule to determine whether a cross-reference either introduces a conflicting requirement, a conflicting definition, or refines an existing requirement. Herein, we propose a legal cross-reference taxonomy to aid requirements engineers in classifying cross-references as they specify compliance requirements. Analyzing cross-references enables us to address conflicting requirements that may otherwise thwart legal compliance. We identify five sets of conflicting compliance requirements and recommend strategies for resolving these conflicts.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0152-5,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Conflicting requirements', 'Regulatory compliance', 'Software compliance engineering', 'Financial systems', 'Healthcare IT']",26Citations,Springer,,Jeremy C.

Early failure prediction in feature request management systems: an extended study,,"Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, UK",25-Apr-12,"AbstractOnline feature request management systems are popular tools for gathering stakeholders’ change requests during system evolution. Deciding which feature requests require attention and how much upfront analysis to perform on them is an important problem in this context: too little upfront analysis may result in inadequate functionalities being developed, costly changes, and wasted development effort; too much upfront analysis is a waste of time and resources. Early predictions about which feature requests are most likely to fail due to insufficient or inadequate upfront analysis could facilitate such decisions. Our objective is to study whether it is possible to make such predictions automatically from the characteristics of the online discussions on feature requests. This paper presents a study of feature request failures in seven large projects, an automated tool-implemented framework for constructing failure prediction models, and a comparison of the performance of the different prediction techniques for these projects. The comparison relies on a cost-benefit model for assessing the value of additional upfront analysis. In this model, the value of additional upfront analysis depends on its probability of success in preventing failures and on the relative cost of the failures it prevents compared to its own cost. We show that for reasonable estimations of these two parameters, automated prediction models provide more value than a set of baselines for many failure types and projects. This suggests automated failure prediction during requirements elicitation to be a promising approach for guiding requirements engineering efforts in online settings.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0150-7,,"['Early failure prediction', 'Cost-benefit of requirements engineering', 'Feature requests management systems', 'Global software development', 'Open source']",8Citations,Springer,,Camilo Fitzgerald,Emmanuel Letier,Anthony Finkelstein,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-012-0150-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Are use cases effective as requirements? To answer this question, we invited professionals and researchers to specify requirements for the same project: Acquire a new system to support a hotline. Among the 15 replies, eight used traditional use cases that specified a dialog between user and system. Seven used a related technique, task description, which specified the customer’s needs without specifying a dialog. It also allowed the analyst to specify problem requirements—problems to be handled by the new system. It turned out that the traditional use cases covered the customer’s needs poorly in areas where improvement was important but difficult. Use cases also restricted the solution space severely.

Enhancing security requirements engineering by organizational learning,,"Software Engineering Group, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Welfengarten 1, 30167, Hannover, Germany",27-Nov-11,"AbstractMore and more software projects today are security-related in one way or the other. Requirements engineers without expertise in security are at risk of overlooking security requirements, which often leads to security vulnerabilities that can later be exploited in practice. Identifying security-relevant requirements is labor-intensive and error-prone. In order to facilitate the security requirements elicitation process, we present an approach supporting organizational learning on security requirements by establishing company-wide experience resources and a socio-technical network to benefit from them. The approach is based on modeling the flow of requirements and related experiences. Based on those models, we enable people to exchange experiences about security-relevant requirements while they write and discuss project requirements. At the same time, the approach enables participating stakeholders to learn while they write requirements. This can increase security awareness and facilitate learning on both individual and organizational levels. As a basis for our approach, we introduce heuristic assistant tools. They support reuse of existing experiences that are relevant for security. In particular, they include Bayesian classifiers that issue a warning automatically when new requirements seem to be security-relevant. Our results indicate that this is feasible, in particular if the classifier is trained with domain-specific data and documents from previous projects. We show how the ability to identify security-relevant requirements can be improved using this approach. We illustrate our approach by providing a step-by-step example of how we improved the security requirements engineering process at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and report on experiences made in this application.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0141-0,,"['Secure software engineering', 'Requirements analysis', 'Organizational learning', 'Requirements workflow modeling']",26Citations,Springer,,Kurt Schneider,Eric Knauss,Siv Houmb,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-011-0141-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Automotive behavioral requirements expressed in a specification pattern system: a case study at BOSCH,,"Robert Bosch GmbH, Corporate Research, Stuttgart, Germany",24-Jan-12,"Abstract To allow an automatic formal analysis of requirements, the requirements have to be formalized first. However, logical formalisms are seldom accessible to stakeholders in the automotive context. Konrad and Cheng proposed a specification pattern system (SPS) represented in a restricted English grammar that can be automatically translated to logics, but looks like natural language. In this paper, we investigate whether this SPS can be applied to automotive requirements of BOSCH, in the sense that it is expressive enough to specify automotive behavioral requirements of BOSCH. We did a case study over 289 informal behavioral requirements taken from automotive BOSCH projects. We evaluated whether these requirements could be formulated in the SPS and whether the SPS has to be adapted to the automotive context. The case study strongly indicates that the SPS, extended with 3 further patterns, is suited to specify automotive behavioral requirements at BOSCH.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0145-9,,"['Automotive', 'Requirements', 'Formalization', 'Real-time']",27Citations,Springer,,Amalinda Post,Igor Menzel,Jochen Hoenicke,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-011-0145-9,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

WebSpec: a visual language for specifying interaction and navigation requirements in web applications,,"LIFIA, Facultad de Informática, UNLP, La Plata, Argentina",24-Jun-11,"AbstractWeb application development is a complex and time-consuming process that involves different stakeholders (ranging from customers to developers); these applications have some unique characteristics like navigational access to information, sophisticated interaction features, etc. However, there have been few proposals to represent those requirements that are specific to Web applications. Consequently, validation of requirements (e.g., in acceptance tests) is usually informal and as a result troublesome. To overcome these problems, we present WebSpec, a domain-specific language for specifying the most relevant and characteristic requirements of Web applications: those involving interaction and navigation. We describe WebSpec diagrams, discussing their abstraction and expressive power. With a simple though realistic example, we show how we have used WebSpec in the context of an agile Web development approach discussing several issues such as automatic test generation, management of changes in requirements, and improving the understanding of the diagrams through application simulation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0124-1,,"['Web requirements', 'Interaction', 'Testing', 'Simulation', 'Code generation']",17Citations,Springer,,Esteban Robles Luna,Gustavo Rossi,Irene Garrigós,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-011-0124-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
On eliciting requirements from end-users in the ICT4D domain,,"Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, Concordia University, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. West, EV 8.401, Montreal, QC, H3G 1M8, Canada",14-Jul-11,"AbstractCurrently, there is much interest in harnessing the potential of new and affordable Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as mobile phones, to assist in reducing disparities in socioeconomic conditions throughout the world. Such efforts have come to be known as ICT for Development or ICT4D. Although this field of research holds much promise, few projects have managed to achieve long-term sustained success. Among the many reasons for this, from a software engineering perspective, in many cases, it can be attributed to inadequacies in gathering and defining software requirements. Incomplete software requirements and the consequent failures in creating sustainable systems arise because of inadequate consideration of the high-level social development goals, neglect of environmental constraints and/or a lack of adequate input from end-users regarding their specific needs and socio-cultural context. We propose enhancements to the requirements elicitation methodology specifically adapted to address these shortcomings. Our approach incorporates the novel technique of Structured Digital Storytelling to elicit input from end-users who have limited literacy and applies a conceptual model derived from Communications Theory to analyse the constraints that arise from their socio-cultural context. The needs, goals and constraints thus identified are integrated using a goal-based analysis to produce a more informed understanding of the potential areas of technology intervention and the needed software requirements.

Moreover, all the project management is integrally affected by stakeholders’ perspectives and their participation. This effect is strengthened when projects involve several organizations. Thus, a clear and explicit representation of the stakeholders and their attributes is required in order to achieve their effective management. The integration of this representation with other models capturing the knowledge of engineering design processes can be of great utility in software development projects. In this sense, this article describes the construction of an integrated model for representing stakeholders in information systems design processes. This proposal considers diverse attributes related to stakeholders and gives information for performing quantitative calculations about their interest and influence over the project.

Representing and reasoning about preferences in requirements engineering,,"School of Information Technology, York University, Toronto, Canada",12-Aug-11,"AbstractThe priorities that stakeholders associate with requirements may vary from stakeholder to stakeholder and from one situation to the next. Differing priorities, in turn, imply different design decisions for the system to be. While elicitation of requirement priorities is a well-studied activity, modeling and reasoning with prioritization has not enjoyed equal attention. In this paper, we address this problem by extending a state-of-the-art goal modeling notation to support the representation of preference (“nice-to-have”) requirements. In our extension, preference goals are distinguished from mandatory ones. Then, quantitative prioritizations of the former are constructed and used as criteria for evaluating alternative ways to achieve the latter. To generate solutions, an existing preference-based planner is utilized to efficiently search for alternatives that best satisfy a given set of mandatory and preferred requirements. With such a planning tool, analysts can acquire a better understanding of the impact of high-level stakeholder preferences on low-level design decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0129-9,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Goal modeling', 'Preference specification']",88Citations,Springer,,Sotirios Liaskos,Sheila A.

Analysing anaphoric ambiguity in natural language requirements,,"Department of Computing, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, UK",13-May-11,"AbstractMany requirements documents are written in natural language (NL). However, with the flexibility of NL comes the risk of introducing unwanted ambiguities in the requirements and misunderstandings between stakeholders. In this paper, we describe an automated approach to identify potentially nocuous ambiguity, which occurs when text is interpreted differently by different readers. We concentrate on anaphoric ambiguity, which occurs when readers may disagree on how pronouns should be interpreted. We describe a number of heuristics, each of which captures information that may lead a reader to favor a particular interpretation of the text. We use these heuristics to build a classifier, which in turn predicts the degree to which particular interpretations are preferred. We collected multiple human judgements on the interpretation of requirements exhibiting anaphoric ambiguity and showed how the distribution of these judgements can be used to assess whether a particular instance of ambiguity is nocuous. Given a requirements document written in natural language, our approach can identify sentences that contain anaphoric ambiguity, and use the classifier to alert the requirements writer of text that runs the risk of misinterpretation. We report on a series of experiments that we conducted to evaluate the performance of the automated system we developed to support our approach. The results show that the system achieves high recall with a consistent improvement on baseline precision subject to some ambiguity tolerance levels, allowing us to explore and highlight realistic and potentially problematic ambiguities in actual requirements documents.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0119-y,,"['Nocuous ambiguity', 'Natural language requirements', 'Anaphoric ambiguity', 'Noun-phrase coreference resolution', 'Antecedent preference heuristics', 'Human judgements', 'Machine learning']",82Citations,Springer,,Hui Yang,Anne de Roeck,Vincenzo Gervasi,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-011-0119-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

The simple swarm technique generated requirements traceability matrices between textual requirements artifacts (high-level requirements traced to low-level requirements, for example). When compared with a baseline information retrieval tracing method, the swarm algorithms showed mixed results.

In this paper, we propose a new technique for automated abstraction identification called relevance-based abstraction identification (RAI), and evaluate its performance—in multiple configurations and through two refinements—compared to other tools and techniques proposed in the literature, where we find that RAI significantly outperforms previous techniques.

Well-specified requirements are crucial for good software design; they depend on the understanding of the domain. Thus, domain engineering becomes an essential activity. The possibility to have a formal model of a domain, consistent with the use of formal methods for developing critical software working within it, is an important issue. Safety-critical domains, like transportation, exhibit interesting features, such as high levels of nondeterminism, complex interactions, stringent safety properties, and multifaceted timing attributes. The formal representation of these features is a challenging task. We explore the possibility of utilizing Event-B as a domain engineering tool. We discuss the problems we faced during this exercise and how we tackled them.

Ironically, however, some traditional documentation artifacts come to support this kind of interaction. In this study, we examine the relationship between software and documentation. We develop an approach that enables incorporating domain documentation to agile development, while keeping the processes adaptive. We also provide a system design that actively uses domain knowledge documentation.

Goal-driven risk assessment in requirements engineering,,"Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy",11-Sep-10,"AbstractRisk analysis is traditionally considered a critical activity for the whole software system’s lifecycle. Risks are identified by considering technical aspects (e.g., failures of the system, unavailability of services, etc.) and handled by suitable countermeasures through a refined design.

Risks are analyzed along with stakeholder interests, and then countermeasures are identified and introduced as part of the system’s requirements. This work extends the Tropos goal modeling formal framework proposing new concepts, qualitative reasoning techniques, and methodological procedures.

RE researchers are generally concerned with a set of open issues such as: (i) the need for a well-defined process to identify and specify the requirements scope, (ii) suitable mechanisms to support communication among different stakeholders and development teams involved in the RE process, (iii) mechanisms to deal with the inherent volatility of requirements, and (iv) the need for a traceability scheme to help managing requirements in the downstream phases of the development process. In this work, we address some of these open issues by proposing the use of an iterative and incremental model-driven RE process combined with the employment of different notations such as controlled natural language and ontology in each activity of RE process. Based on the argument that there is no single notation suitable to represent requirements from the different perspectives of all the stakeholders and development teams, we propose a RE process encompassing different views, representing each perspective. This paper describes the proposed process, its tool support, and presents a controlled experiment that illustrates the proposal and evaluates its benefits.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0116-1,,"['Requirement engineering process', 'Model-driven development', 'MDA', 'Ontology', 'Controlled natural language']",15Citations,Springer,,Paulo F.

The “Panopticon” of search engines: the response of the European data protection framework,,"Interdisciplinary Centre for Law and ICT (ICRI), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Sint-Michielsstraat 6, 3000, Leuven, Belgium",19-May-10,"AbstractNowadays, Internet users are depending on various search engines in order to be able to find requested information on the Web. Although most users feel that they are and remain anonymous when they place their search queries, reality proves otherwise. The increasing importance of search engines for the location of the desired information on the Internet usually leads to considerable inroads into the privacy of users. A heated debate is currently ongoing at European level regarding the question if search engine providers that are established outside the European Union are covered by the European data protection framework and the obligations it imposes on entities that process personal data. The scope of this paper is to examine the applicability of the European data protection legislation to non-EU-based search engine providers and to study the main privacy issues with regard to search engines, such as the character of search logs, their anonymisation and their retention period. Ixquick, a privacy-friendly meta-search engine, will be presented as an alternative to privacy intrusive existing practices of search engines.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-010-0107-7,,"['Search engines', 'Privacy', 'Cookies', 'Search logs']",1Citation,Springer,,Eleni Kosta,Christos Kalloniatis,Lilian Mitrou,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-010-0107-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

The leading force behind the approach is the ambition to develop a methodology for building and maintaining security cases throughout the system development life cycle in a typical system engineering effort, when much of the information relevant for assurance is produced and feedback can be provided to system developers.

Commitment analysis to operationalize software requirements from privacy policies,,"Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA",10-Jun-10,"AbstractOnline privacy policies describe organizations’ privacy practices for collecting, storing, using, and protecting consumers’ personal information. Users need to understand these policies in order to know how their personal information is being collected, stored, used, and protected. Organizations need to ensure that the commitments they express in their privacy policies reflect their actual business practices, especially in the United States where the Federal Trade Commission regulates fair business practices. Requirements engineers need to understand the privacy policies to know the privacy practices with which the software must comply and to ensure that the commitments expressed in these privacy policies are incorporated into the software requirements. In this paper, we present a methodology for obtaining requirements from privacy policies based on our theory of commitments, privileges, and rights, which was developed through a grounded theory approach. This methodology was developed from a case study in which we derived software requirements from seventeen healthcare privacy policies. We found that legal-based approaches do not provide sufficient coverage of privacy requirements because privacy policies focus primarily on procedural practices rather than legal practices.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-010-0108-6,,"['Requirement', 'Privacy policy', 'Compliance', 'Privacy aware', 'Commitment', 'Privilege', 'Right']",25Citations,Springer,,Jessica D.

A privacy threat analysis framework: supporting the elicitation and fulfillment of privacy requirements,,"Electrical Engineering Department, IBBT-COSIC, K.U. Leuven Kasteelpark Arenberg 10, 3001, Heverlee, Belgium",16-Nov-10,"AbstractReady or not, the digitalization of information has come, and privacy is standing out there, possibly at stake. Although digital privacy is an identified priority in our society, few systematic, effective methodologies exist that deal with privacy threats thoroughly. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to model privacy threats in software-based systems. First, this work provides a systematic methodology to model privacy-specific threats. Analogous to STRIDE, an information flow–oriented model of the system is leveraged to guide the analysis and to provide broad coverage. The methodology instructs the analyst on what issues should be investigated, and where in the model those issues could emerge. This is achieved by (i) defining a list of privacy threat types and (ii) providing the mappings between threat types and the elements in the system model. Second, this work provides an extensive catalog of privacy-specific threat tree patterns that can be used to detail the threat analysis outlined above. Finally, this work provides the means to map the existing privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) to the identified privacy threats. Therefore, the selection of sound privacy countermeasures is simplified.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-010-0115-7,,"['Privacy', 'Threat modeling', 'Requirements', 'Secure software engineering']",321Citations,Springer,,Mina Deng,Kim Wuyts,Riccardo Scandariato,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-010-0115-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

To capture multi-level, role-based and Separation of Duty authorisation requirements, new model element attributes and authorisation artefacts are introduced. To enhance the usability of this approach, simple visual decorators are specified to ease the communication of requirements between various stakeholders. To provide an early validation of these authorisation requirements during the definition of a process model, formal semantics are applied to the process model and model-checking techniques are used to provide feedback.

A goal-based framework for contextual requirements modeling and analysis,,"DISI, University of Trento, Via Sommarive 14, 38123, Povo, Trento, Italy",27-Jul-10,"AbstractRequirements engineering (RE) research often ignores or presumes a uniform nature of the context in which the system operates. This assumption is no longer valid in emerging computing paradigms, such as ambient, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, where it is essential to monitor and adapt to an inherently varying context. Besides influencing the software, context may influence stakeholders’ goals and their choices to meet them. In this paper, we propose a goal-oriented RE modeling and reasoning framework for systems operating in varying contexts. We introduce contextual goal models to relate goals and contexts; context analysis to refine contexts and identify ways to verify them; reasoning techniques to derive requirements reflecting the context and users priorities at runtime; and finally, design time reasoning techniques to derive requirements for a system to be developed at minimum cost and valid in all considered contexts.

A framework to improve communication during the requirements elicitation process in GSD projects,,"GIISCo Research Group, Faculty of Informatics, National University of Comahue, Neuquén, Argentina",21-May-10,"AbstractAchieving a shared understanding of requirements is difficult in any situation, even more so in global software development projects. In such environments, people must deal not only with the lack of face to face communication, but also with other issues such as time difference, cultural diversity and a large amount of information originating from different sources throughout the world. Obtaining the right requirements therefore implies extra effort. In order to minimize such problems, we propose a framework that focuses on analyzing the factors that may be problematic in global software development and which suggests a set of strategies to improve the requirements elicitation process in such environments. In this paper, we describe the different phases of our framework and present the results of an experiment that test part of this framework. The results indicate that applying some of the strategies proposed in the framework seems to positively affect the stakeholders’ satisfaction with regard to communication.

An integrated approach for requirement selection and scheduling in software release planning,,"Information Systems Group, University of Twente, P.O. Box 217, 7500 AE, Enschede, The Netherlands",05-May-10,"AbstractIt is essential for product software companies to decide which requirements should be included in the next release and to make an appropriate time plan of the development project. Compared to the extensive research done on requirement selection, very little research has been performed on time scheduling. In this paper, we introduce two integer linear programming models that integrate time scheduling into software release planning. Given the resource and precedence constraints, our first model provides a schedule for developing the requirements such that the project duration is minimized. Our second model combines requirement selection and scheduling, so that it not only maximizes revenues but also simultaneously calculates an on-time-delivery project schedule. Since requirement dependencies are essential for scheduling the development process, we present a more detailed analysis of these dependencies. Furthermore, we present two mechanisms that facilitate dynamic adaptation for over-estimation or under-estimation of revenues or processing time, one of which includes the Scrum methodology. Finally, several simulations based on real-life data are performed. The results of these simulations indicate that requirement dependency can significantly influence the requirement selection and the corresponding project plan. Moreover, the model for combined requirement selection and scheduling outperforms the sequential selection and scheduling approach in terms of efficiency and on-time delivery.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-010-0104-x,available,"['Requirement selection', 'Requirement scheduling', 'Release planning', 'Requirement dependency', 'Integer linear programming (ILP)', 'Simulation', 'Scrum']",35Citations,Springer,,Chen Li,Marjan van den Akker,Sjaak Brinkkemper,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-010-0104-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Assessing traceability of software engineering artifacts,,"Microsoft, Redmond, WA, 98052, USA",20-Jan-10,"AbstractThe generation of traceability links or traceability matrices is vital to many software engineering activities. It is also person-power intensive, time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks tool support. The activities that require traceability information include, but are not limited to, risk analysis, impact analysis, criticality assessment, test coverage analysis, and verification and validation of software systems. Information Retrieval (IR) techniques have been shown to assist with the automated generation of traceability links by reducing the time it takes to generate the traceability mapping. Researchers have applied techniques such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), vector space retrieval, and probabilistic IR and have enjoyed some success. This paper concentrates on examining issues not previously widely studied in the context of traceability: the importance of the vocabulary base used for tracing and the evaluation and assessment of traceability mappings and methods using secondary measures.

Understanding the human context in requirements elicitation,,"Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain",14-Aug-09,"AbstractThe human context within which a software system will operate is fundamental for its requirements. It may not appear to be very much related to the system, but it is very relevant in achieving its successful adoption. However, requirements engineers have usually a background in Software Engineering and are not trained to elicit this kind of information. This situation raises the need for analytical tools to deal with these features. These tools should enable collaborative work between requirements engineers, who use them in development, social practitioners, who provide the knowledge and processes underlying these tools, and the customers, who know the domain and intended application of the projects. The framework presented in this paper is based on the socio-psychological Activity Theory and its analysis of human contexts. It includes a repository of social properties and a process to perform this elicitation using it. The paper illustrates its application through a case study on the impact of a new system in the organization of a firm.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0087-7,,"['Software psychology', 'Elicitation methods', 'Human context', 'Activity Theory', 'Activity Checklist', 'Conflicts']",40Citations,Springer,,Rubén Fuentes-Fernández,Jorge J.

When-to-release decisions for features with time-dependent value functions,,"Laboratory for Software Engineering Decision Support, University of Calgary, 2500 University Dr. NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N4, Canada",16-Feb-10,"AbstractRelease planning is of key importance for incremental software product development. With the increasing size and complexity of software products, as well as with the growing demands for transparency and objectivity of decision-making, intuition alone is no longer sufficient for release planning. EVOLVE+ is a systematic method for release planning, which combines the strengths of formalization and computational efficiency with the expertise of the human experts. From a given set of candidate features, the most attractive ones are selected and assigned to a sequence of releases. In this paper, we consider three extensions to the current systematic planning approach EVOLVE+: (a) value functions describing the estimated value of the feature are continuous functions of time, (b) the actual release dates are no longer fixed but can be varied in some pre-defined interval. As a consequence, the available resource capacities are also functions of time. (c) Calculation of trade-off solutions balancing the risk with the potential additional value of early release. All three extensions substantially increase the complexity of the release planning problem. We have developed a solution method using genetic algorithms that is able to accommodate the additional complexity of the advanced model.

Specifically, no scientific studies have been conducted on the “characteristic” differences between the newly elicited requirements gathered in the presence or absence of an existing software architecture. This paper describes an exploratory controlled study investigating such requirements characteristics. We identify a multitude of characteristics (e.g., end-user focus, technological focus, and importance) that were affected by the presence or absence of an SA, together with the extent of this effect. Furthermore, we identify the specific aspects of the architecture that had an impact on the characteristics.

RELAX: a language to address uncertainty in self-adaptive systems requirement,,"Computing Department, InfoLab 21, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4AW, UK",30-Mar-10,"AbstractSelf-adaptive systems have the capability to autonomously modify their behavior at run-time in response to changes in their environment. Self-adaptation is particularly necessary for applications that must run continuously, even under adverse conditions and changing requirements; sample domains include automotive systems, telecommunications, and environmental monitoring systems. While a few techniques have been developed to support the monitoring and analysis of requirements for adaptive systems, limited attention has been paid to the actual creation and specification of requirements of self-adaptive systems. As a result, self-adaptivity is often constructed in an ad-hoc manner. In order to support the rigorous specification of adaptive systems requirements, this paper introduces RELAX, a new requirements language for self-adaptive systems that explicitly addresses uncertainty inherent in adaptive systems. We present the formal semantics for RELAX in terms of fuzzy logic, thus enabling a rigorous treatment of requirements that include uncertainty. RELAX enables developers to identify uncertainty in the requirements, thereby facilitating the design of systems that are, by definition, more flexible and amenable to adaptation in a systematic fashion. We illustrate the use of RELAX on smart home applications, including an adaptive assisted living system.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-010-0101-0,,"['Adaptive systems', 'Requirements engineering', 'Fuzzy logic', 'Smart homes', 'Uncertainty']",150Citations,Springer,,Jon Whittle,Pete Sawyer,Nelly Bencomo,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-010-0101-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Deconstructing the semantics of big-step modelling languages,,"Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada",14-Apr-10,"AbstractWith the popularity of model-driven methodologies and the abundance of modelling languages, a major question for a requirements engineer is: which language is suitable for modelling a system under study? We address this question from a semantic point-of-view for big-step modelling languages (BSMLs). BSMLs are a class of popular behavioural modelling languages in which a model can respond to an input by executing multiple transitions, possibly concurrently. We deconstruct the operational semantics of a large class of BSMLs into eight high-level, mostly orthogonal semantic aspects and their common semantic options. We analyse the characteristics of each semantic option. We use feature diagrams to present the design space of BSML semantics that arises from our deconstruction, as well as to taxonomize the syntactic features of BSMLs that exhibit semantic variations. We enumerate the dependencies between syntactic and semantic features. We also discuss the effects of certain combinations of semantic options when used together in a BSML semantics. Our goal is to empower a requirements engineer to compare and choose an appropriate BSML from the plethora of existing BSMLs, or to articulate the semantic features of a new desired BSML when such a BSML does not exist.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-010-0102-z,,"['Big-step modelling languages', 'Semantics of modelling languages', 'Model-driven development', 'Domain-specific modelling languages', 'Statecharts', 'UML StateMachines']",20Citations,Springer,,Shahram Esmaeilsabzali,Nancy A.

Modeling and detecting semantic-based interactions in aspect-oriented scenarios,,"SITE, University of Ottawa, 800 King Edward, Ottawa, ON, K1N 6N5, Canada",04-Mar-10,"AbstractInteractions between dependent or conflicting aspects are a well-known problem with aspect-oriented development (as well as related paradigms). These interactions are potentially dangerous and can lead to unexpected or incorrect results when aspects are composed. To date, the majority of aspect interaction detection methods either have been based on purely syntactic comparisons or have relied on heavyweight formal methods. We present a new approach that is based instead on lightweight semantic annotations of aspects. Each aspect is annotated with domain-specific markers and a separate influence model describes how semantic markers from different domains influence each other. Automated analysis can then be used both to highlight semantic aspect conflicts and to trade-off aspects. We apply this technique to early aspects, namely, aspect scenarios, because it is desirable to detect aspect interactions as early in the software lifecycle as possible. We evaluate the technique using two case studies—one from industry and one posed as a challenge problem by the community—and show that the technique detects interactions that cannot be discovered using syntactic techniques. In addition, we show that the technique can apply to many languages through the use of different aspect-oriented scenario notations in the case studies, namely, MATA sequence diagrams and Aspect-oriented Use Case Maps.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-010-0098-4,,"['Aspects', 'Goal-oriented Requirement Language', 'Interaction detection', 'Semantic interactions', 'MATA', 'Sequence diagrams', 'UML', 'User Requirements Notation', 'Aspect-oriented Use Case Maps']",5Citations,Springer,,Gunter Mussbacher,Jon Whittle,Daniel Amyot,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-010-0098-4,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

We evaluate the i* visual notation using a set of principles for designing cognitively effective visual notations (the Physics of Notations). The analysis reveals some serious flaws in the notation together with some practical recommendations for improvement.

The security standard ISO 14508 Common Criteria (CC) together with secure design techniques such as UMLsec can provide the security expertise, knowledge, and guidelines that are needed. However, security expertise and guidelines are not stated explicitly in the CC. They are rather phrased in security domain terminology and difficult to understand for developers. This means that some general security and secure design expertise are required to fully take advantage of the CC and UMLsec. In addition, there is the problem of tracing security requirements and objectives into solution design, which is needed for proof of requirements fulfilment. This paper describes a security requirements engineering methodology called SecReq. SecReq combines three techniques: the CC, the heuristic requirements editor HeRA, and UMLsec. SecReq makes systematic use of the security engineering knowledge contained in the CC and UMLsec, as well as security-related heuristics in the HeRA tool. The integrated SecReq method supports early detection of security-related issues (HeRA), their systematic refinement guided by the CC, and the ability to trace security requirements into UML design models. A feedback loop helps reusing experience within SecReq and turns the approach into an iterative process for the secure system life-cycle, also in the presence of system evolution.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0093-9,,"['Security requirement elicitation', 'Common Criteria (CC)', 'UMLsec', 'Heuristics', 'Secure design']",86Citations,Springer,,Siv Hilde Houmb,Shareeful Islam,Eric Knauss,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-009-0093-9,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A comparison of security requirements engineering methods,,"Institute of Information Systems, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany",26-Nov-09,"AbstractThis paper presents a conceptual framework for security engineering, with a strong focus on security requirements elicitation and analysis. This conceptual framework establishes a clear-cut vocabulary and makes explicit the interrelations between the different concepts and notions used in security engineering. Further, we apply our conceptual framework to compare and evaluate current security requirements engineering approaches, such as the Common Criteria, Secure Tropos, SREP, MSRA, as well as methods based on UML and problem frames. We review these methods and assess them according to different criteria, such as the general approach and scope of the method, its validation, and quality assurance capabilities. Finally, we discuss how these methods are related to the conceptual framework and to one another.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0092-x,,"['Security requirement', 'Security requirement engineering', 'Comparison', 'Framework for security requirement engineering']",154Citations,Springer,,Benjamin Fabian,Seda Gürses,Maritta Heisel,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-009-0092-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Evaluating existing security and privacy requirements for legal compliance,,"Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA",13-Nov-09,"AbstractGovernments enact laws and regulations to safeguard the security and privacy of their citizens. In response, requirements engineers must specify compliant system requirements to satisfy applicable legal security and privacy obligations. Specifying legally compliant requirements is challenging because legal texts are complex and ambiguous by nature. In this paper, we discuss our evaluation of the requirements for iTrust, an open-source Electronic Health Records system, for compliance with legal requirements governing security and privacy in the healthcare domain. We begin with an overview of the method we developed, using existing requirements engineering techniques, and then summarize our experiences in applying our method to the iTrust system. We illustrate some of the challenges that practitioners face when specifying requirements for a system that must comply with law and close with a discussion of needed future research focusing on security and privacy requirements.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0089-5,,"['Security requirements', 'Privacy requirements', 'Legal compliance', 'Refactoring requirements']",49Citations,Springer,,Aaron K.

"A vulnerability-centric requirements engineering framework: analyzing security attacks, countermeasures, and requirements based on vulnerabilities",,"University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",17-Nov-09,"AbstractMany security breaches occur because of exploitation of vulnerabilities within the system. Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the requirements, design, and implementation, which attackers exploit to compromise the system.

A UML-based static verification framework for security,,"Department of Computing, City University London Northampton Square, London, EC1V, UK",03-Dec-09,"AbstractSecure software engineering is a new research area that has been proposed to address security issues during the development of software systems. This new area of research advocates that security characteristics should be considered from the early stages of the software development life cycle and should not be added as another layer in the system on an ad-hoc basis after the system is built. In this paper, we describe a UML-based Static Verification Framework (USVF) to support the design and verification of secure software systems in early stages of the software development life-cycle taking into consideration security and general requirements of the software system. USVF performs static verification on UML models consisting of UML class and state machine diagrams extended by an action language. We present an operational semantics of UML models, define a property specification language designed to reason about temporal and general properties of UML state machines using the semantic domains of the former, and implement the model checking process by translating models and properties into Promela, the input language of the SPIN model checker. We show that the methodology can be applied to the verification of security properties by representing the main aspects of security, namely availability, integrity and confidentiality, in the USVF property specification language.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0091-y,,"['UML', 'Security requirements', 'Model checking', 'SPIN']",21Citations,Springer,,Igor Siveroni,Andrea Zisman,George Spanoudakis,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-009-0091-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Formal semantic conflict detection in aspect-oriented requirements,,"Computing Department, InfoLab21, South Drive, Lancaster University, LA1 4WA, Lancaster, UK",03-Jun-09,"AbstractThe goal of Aspect-Oriented Requirements Engineering is to identify possible crosscutting concerns, and to develop composition specifications, which can be used to reason about potential conflicts in the requirements. Recent work in AORE has moved from a syntactic approach to composition, which leads to fragile compositions and increased coupling between aspect and base concerns, to a semantic composition approach, based on semantics of the natural language itself. However, such compositions are at present only informally specified, and as such precise conflict detection between the requirements compositions is difficult. We present an approach for the formalisation of these semantic-based compositions which means that logical conflicts between compositions can be precisely identified and understood semantically. We show that the approach can be supported by off-the-shelf tools, meaning it is scalable and feasible for even large requirements specifications.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0083-y,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Aspect-oriented requirements engineering', 'Conflict detection', 'Formal methods', 'Semantic composition', 'Predicate logic']",11Citations,Springer,,Nathan Weston,Ruzanna Chitchyan,Awais Rashid,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-009-0083-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Experiential learning approach for requirements engineering education,,"School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015, Lausanne, Switzerland",20-Jun-09,"AbstractThe use of requirements engineering (RE) in industry is hampered by a poor understanding of its practices and their benefits. Teaching RE at the university level is therefore an important endeavor. Shortly before students become engineers and enter the workforce, this education could ideally be provided as an integrated part of developing the requisite business skills for understanding RE. Because much social wisdom is packed into RE methods, it is unrealistic to expect students with little organizational experience to understand and appreciate this body of knowledge; hence, the necessity of an experiential approach. The course described in this paper uses an active, affective, experiential pedagogy giving students the opportunity to experience a simulated work environment that demonstrates the social/design–problem complexities and richness of a development organization in the throes of creating a new product. Emotional and technical debriefing is conducted after each meaningful experience so that students and faculty, alike can better understand the professional relevancies of what they have just experienced. This includes an examination of the many forces encountered in industrial settings but not normally discussed in academic settings. The course uses a low-tech social simulation, rather than software simulation, so that students learn through interaction with real people, and are therefore confronted with the complexity of true social relationships.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0084-x,,"['RE education', 'Active learning', 'Affective pedagogy', 'Experiential learning']",43Citations,Springer,,Gil Regev,Donald C.

Technology transfer decision support in requirements engineering research: a systematic review of REj,,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, 412 96, Göteborg, Sweden",07-Mar-09,"AbstractOne of the main goals of an applied research field such as requirements engineering is the transfer of research results to industrial use. To promote industrial adoption of technologies developed in academia, researchers need to provide tangible evidence of the advantages of using them. This can be done through industry validation, enabling researchers to test and validate technologies in a real setting with real users and applications. The evidence obtained, together with detailed information on how the validation was conducted, offers rich decision support material for industrial practitioners seeking to adopt new technologies. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of all papers published in the Requirements Engineering journal containing any type of technology evaluation. The aim is to gauge the support for technology transfer, i.e., to what degree industrial practitioners can use the reporting of technology evaluations in the journal as decision support for adopting the technologies in industrial practice. Findings show that very few evaluations offer full technology transfer support, i.e., have a realistic scale, application or subjects. The major improvement potential concerning support for technology transfer is found to be the subjects used in the evaluations. Attaining company support, including support for using practitioners as subjects, is vital for technology transfer and for researchers seeking to validate technologies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0080-1,,"['Systematic review', 'Requirements engineering', 'Technology transfer']",58Citations,Springer,,Martin Ivarsson,Tony Gorschek,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-009-0080-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Investigating business-IT alignment through multi-disciplinary goal concepts,,"Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T1Z2, Canada",10-Apr-09,"AbstractThe alignment of information technology (IT) with business strategies is optimal when harmony exists between organizational and system goals. Empirical evidence reveals that effective strategic alignment leads to superior financial performance for organizations. This observation has spurred extensive research into business-IT alignment. Yet, the issue of alignment remains a top concern for CIOs. We argue that the parochial view undertaken by past research into business-IT alignment is a probable cause for continuing system failures. Furthermore, strategic alignment research is limited and devoid within the requirements engineering discipline. In this paper, we highlight existing shortfalls of research in business-IT alignment, and bring to light insights that may be offered by other disciplines to augment this field. Subscribing to a multi-disciplinary perspective, we develop a goal-based framework that incorporates goals from various literatures in investigating business-IT alignment. One of the novelties of our proposed framework lies in its delineation between goals that have been originally assigned to stakeholders versus those interpreted by stakeholders. Additionally, the framework includes constructs at the strategic level for supporting the rationale of strategic level goals. We tested the usefulness and usability of this methodology in an organization with a newly developed information system founded on strategic business goals and reported lessons learnt from both researchers’ and practitioners’ perspectives.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0081-0,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Goal-based frameworks', 'Business-IT alignment']",32Citations,Springer,,Sase Narine Singh,Carson Woo,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-009-0081-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Methodologies to evolve formal specifications through refinement and retrenchment in an analysis–revision cycle,,"Department of Telematics Engineering, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain",12-Feb-09,"AbstractThe development of requirement specifications is done by accumulating knowledge about the desired systems in a progressive manner. This process can be supported by an analysis–revision cycle, in which the analysis phase checks the correctness of a given specification, and the revision phase modifies it, in case some problems are detected. To date, the analysis and revision activities have been typically considered in isolation, resulting in ineffective support to the stakeholders’ work. In response to that, this article introduces methodologies to conduct an interactive and integrated approach, grounded on the formalization of two basic types of evolutions (refinements and retrenchments) over multi-valued specification and modeling formalisms.

Requirements engineering for multi-channel services: the SEB method and its application to a multi-channel bank,,"Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, School of Engineering, University of Porto, R. Roberto Frias, 4200-465, Porto, Portugal",26-May-09,"AbstractThe widespread usage of technology for service provision to customers has created a new and challenging environment for the design of interactive systems, with the emergence of technology enabled multi-channel services. Requirements engineers involved in the design of such service systems must actively work together with interaction designers and service managers to better integrate customer service experience and technology components, requiring unifying methods and tools within the emerging field of service science management and engineering. This paper proposes the service experience blueprint (SEB), a multidisciplinary method for the design of technology enabled multi-channel service systems and illustrates its application in two examples of redesign of banking services that involved an extensive study with more than 4,000 bank customers. The SEB method is based on concepts and tools from RE and interaction design, such as goal-oriented analysis and conceptual modeling, but also uses methods developed in the service and marketing fields, such as service blueprinting. SEB brings marketing research methods to the requirements process, as they can provide a useful contribution for the elicitation of customer experience requirements in service environments. By bringing together goal-oriented modeling and use case modeling from requirements engineering, with service blueprinting from service design, the SEB method contributes to creating a shared understanding and a unifying language to better support the design of new technology enabled multi-channel service systems, where technology and service issues are deeply intertwined.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0082-z,,"['Customer experience requirements', 'Non-functional requirements', 'Goal-oriented analysis', 'Multi-channel service design', 'Service interaction design']",12Citations,Springer,,Lia Patrício,João Falcão e Cunha,Raymond P.

O. Box 9210, 02015, TKK, Finland",26-Feb-09,"AbstractA strong link between strategy and product development is important, since companies need to select requirements for forthcoming releases. However, in practice, connecting requirements engineering (RE) and business planning is far from trivial. This paper describes the lessons learned from four software product companies that have recognized the need for more business-oriented long-term planning. The study was conducted using the action research approach. We identified five practices that seem to strengthen the link between business decisions and RE. These are (1) explicating the planning levels and time horizons; (2) separating the planning of products’ business goals from R&D resource allocation; (3) planning open-endedly with a pre-defined rhythm; (4) emphasizing whole-product thinking; and (5) making solution planning visible. To support whole-product thinking and solution planning, we suggest that companies create solution concepts.

The proposed method utilizes data-mining and machine learning techniques to prioritize requirements according to stakeholders’ interests, business goals, and cross-cutting concerns such as security or performance requirements. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated and evaluated through two case studies based on the requirements of the Ice Breaker System, and also on a set of stakeholders’ raw feature requests mined from the discussion forum of an open source product named SugarCRM.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0079-7,,"['Requirements prioritization', 'Requirements triage', 'Data mining', 'Non-functional requirements']",58Citations,Springer,,Chuan Duan,Paula Laurent,Jane Cleland-Huang,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-009-0079-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

To address this problem, we propose a tool-supported process of requirements analysis for socio-technical systems, which adopts planning techniques for exploring the space of requirements alternatives and a number of social criteria for their evaluation.

A semiotic analysis of unified modeling language graphical notations,,"Department of Management, 209 College of Business Administration, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, 68588-0491, USA",08-Jan-09,"AbstractUnified modeling language (UML) is the standard modeling language for object-oriented system development. Despite its status as a standard, UML has a fuzzy formal specification and a weak theoretical foundation. Semiotics, the study of signs, provides a good theoretical foundation for UML research because graphical notations (or visual signs) of UML are subjected to the principles of signs. In our research, we use semiotics to study the effectiveness of graphical notations in UML. We hypothesized that the use of iconic signs as UML graphical notations leads to representation that is more accurately interpreted and that arouses fewer connotations than the use of symbolic signs. An open-ended survey was used to test these hypotheses. The results support our propositions that iconic UML graphical notations are more accurately interpreted by subjects and that the number of connotations is lower for iconic UML graphical notations than for symbolic UML graphical notations. The results have both theoretical and practical significance. This study illustrates the usefulness of using semiotics as a theoretical underpinning in analyzing, evaluating, and comparing graphical notations for modeling constructs. The results of this research also suggest ways and means of enhancing the graphical notations of UML modeling constructs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-008-0071-7,,"['Unified modeling language', 'Semiotics', 'Modeling methods', 'Graphical notations', 'Systems analysis and design']",14Citations,Springer,,Keng Siau,Yuhong Tian,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-008-0071-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

The product line paradigm has recently been applied to TOS, and a TOS reference architecture has thus been designed. However, TOS requirements specifications have not been developed in any rigorous way with reuse in mind. We therefore believe that an opportunity exists to increase the abstraction level at which stakeholders can reason about this product line. This paper reports an experience in which this TOS domain was analyzed, including the lessons learned in the construction and use of the TOS domain model. The experience is based on the application of extensions of well-known domain analysis techniques, together with the use of quality attribute templates traced to a feature model to deal with non-functional issues.

A software product line is a set of software products sharing a set of common features but containing variation points. Successful SPLE requires making selection decisions at variation points effectively and efficiently. A significant challenge is how to identify, represent and manage the inter-dependency of selection decisions for requirements. We developed the concept of a meta-model for requirement decision models to bring formalism and consistency to the structure and to model inter-dependencies between requirement selection decisions. Here we present a meta-model for requirement selection decisions that includes inter-dependencies and we use a mobile phone worked example to illustrate our approach. To support our method, we developed two separate tools, V-Define (for domain decision model construction) and V-Resolve (for new product derivation).

Method for stakeholder identification in interorganizational environments,,"CIDISI, Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo en Ingeniería en Sistemas de Información, Facultad Regional Santa Fe, Universidad Tecnológica Nacional, Santa Fe, Argentina",09-Sep-08,"AbstractStakeholders are the first emerging challenge in any software project. Their identification is a critical task for success. Nevertheless, many authors consider them as a default product of a non-explained identification process. Several aspects must be considered when the project is carried out in environments where multiple organizations interact. These complex contexts demand extremely hard efforts. Stakeholders must be identified taking into account their attributes (types, roles), which must be extended and defined for these environments. In general, there are no methodologies that allow performing this task in a systematic way for the development of interorganizational information systems. The paper proposes a method for carrying out stakeholder identification considering the diverse dimensions involved in interorganizational environments: organizational, interorganizational and external. It allows the systematic specification of all the people, groups and organizations whose interests and needs can affect or are affected by the interorganizational system.

Portraying the practice of decision-making in requirements engineering: a case of large scale bespoke development,,"School of Humanities and Informatics, University of Skövde, P·O. Box 408, 541 28, Skövde, Sweden",29-Aug-08,"AbstractComplex decision-making is a prominent aspect of requirements engineering (RE) and the need for improved decision support for RE decision-makers has been identified by a number of authors in the research literature. A first step toward better decision support in requirements engineering is to understand multifaceted decision situations of decision-makers. In this paper, the focus is on RE decision-making in large scale bespoke development. The decision situation of RE decision-makers on a subsystem level has been studied at a systems engineering company and is depicted in this paper. These situations are described in terms of, e.g., RE decision matters, RE decision-making activities, and RE decision processes.

Requirements for tools for ambiguity identification and measurement in natural language requirements specifications,,"Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy",02-Jul-08,"AbstractThis paper proposes a two-step approach to identifying ambiguities in natural language (NL) requirements specifications (RSs). In the first step, a tool would apply a set of ambiguity measures to a RS in order to identify potentially ambiguous sentences in the RS. In the second step, another tool would show what specifically is potentially ambiguous about each potentially ambiguous sentence. The final decision of ambiguity remains with the human users of the tools. The paper describes several requirements-identification experiments with several small NL RSs using four prototypes of the first tool based on linguistic instruments and resources of different complexity and a manual mock-up of the second tool.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-008-0063-7,,"['Ambiguity identification', 'Disambiguation', 'Natural language processing', 'Natural langugage', 'Prototype tools', 'Requirements-identification experiments', 'Requirements-identification prototype', 'Requirements specification tools']",83Citations,Springer,,Nadzeya Kiyavitskaya,Nicola Zeni,Luisa Mich,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-008-0063-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Composing requirements specifications from multiple prioritized sources,,"Telematic Engineering Department, University of Vigo, 36310, Vigo, Spain",18-Jun-08,"AbstractThe formal methodology 
MultiSpec
 supports the evolution of software specifications gathered from multiple perspectives. A viewpoint-based approach is used to explicitly separate the descriptions provided by different stakeholders, and concentrate on identifying and resolving conflicts between them. The challenge addressed in this article consists in taking into account that some views may have greater degrees of relevance and, consequently, their opinion will have more importance when either obtaining the merged model or resolving the contradictions. To this end, we propose a priority-based approach, where such priority value is twofold. On the one hand, it considers external factors to the perspectives such as the importance assigned to each view by the analyst depending on who is specifying the view or the amount of stakeholders involved in that specification. On the other hand, this priority value also considers internal factors related to the quality of the views and, in order to be able to quantify this value, 
MultiSpec
 proposes two measures: coverage and density of each perspective which will be combined in a completeness value. The contributions of this approach will be clearly illustrated through a simple example.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-008-0064-6,,"['Viewpoints', 'Incompleteness', 'Inconsistency', 'Requirements specification', 'Prioritization']",6Citations,Springer,,Ana Belén Barragáns Martínez,José J.

Addressing privacy requirements in system design: the PriS method,,"Cultural Informatics Laboratory, Department of Cultural Technology and Communication, University of the Aegean, Harilaou Trikoupi and Faonos Str., 81100, Mytilene, Greece",07-Aug-08,"AbstractA major challenge in the field of software engineering is to make users trust the software that they use in their every day activities for professional or recreational reasons. Trusting software depends on various elements, one of which is the protection of user privacy. Protecting privacy is about complying with user’s desires when it comes to handling personal information. Users’ privacy can also be defined as the right to determine when, how and to what extend information about them is communicated to others. Current research stresses the need for addressing privacy issues during the system design rather than during the system implementation phase. To this end, this paper describes PriS, a security requirements engineering method, which incorporates privacy requirements early in the system development process. PriS considers privacy requirements as organisational goals that need to be satisfied and adopts the use of privacy-process patterns as a way to: (1) describe the effect of privacy requirements on business processes; and (2) facilitate the identification of the system architecture that best supports the privacy-related business processes. In this way, PriS provides a holistic approach from ‘high-level’ goals to ‘privacy-compliant’ IT systems. The PriS way-of-working is formally defined thus, enabling the development of automated tools for assisting its application.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-008-0067-3,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Privacy requirements', 'Formal methods', 'Privacy-process patterns', 'Privacy enhancing technologies', 'Goal-oriented approach', 'System design']",182Citations,Springer,,Christos Kalloniatis,Evangelia Kavakli,Stefanos Gritzalis,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-008-0067-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A cognitive semantics for the association construct,,"Faculty of Business Administration, Memorial University of Newfoundland, 310 Elizabeth Avenue, St. John’s, NL, Canada",19-Jun-08,"AbstractThe unified modelling language (UML), besides its traditional use in describing software artifacts, is increasingly being used for conceptual modelling, the activity of describing an application domain. For models to be clear and unambiguous, every construct of the modelling language must have well-defined semantics, which is its mapping to elements of the semantic domain. When used for conceptual modelling, the semantic domain of UML is the application domain, as perceived by the modeller. Modellers perceive and structure their perceptions using cognitive concepts. This paper proposes a mapping of the UML association construct to those concepts. Implications for the use of the association construct for conceptual modelling are derived, a UML profile for conceptual modelling is presented, along with the results of a case study using the semantics and profile.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-008-0065-5,,"['Object-oriented modelling', 'Associations', 'Natural language', 'Semantics', 'Cognition', 'Psychology']",4Citations,Springer,,Joerg Evermann,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-008-0065-5,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A case study validation of a knowledge-based approach for the selection of requirements engineering techniques,,"School of Computer Science, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, 5005, Australia",22-Nov-07,"AbstractRequirements engineering (RE) is a critical phase in the software engineering process and plays a vital role in ensuring the overall quality of a software product. Recent research has shown that industry increasingly recognizes the importance of good RE practices and the use of appropriate RE techniques. However, due to the large number of RE techniques, requirements engineers find it challenging to select suitable techniques for a particular project. Unfortunately, technique selection based on personal experience has limitations with regards to the scope, effectiveness and suitability of the RE techniques for the project at hand. In this paper, a Knowledge-based Approach for the Selection of Requirements Engineering Techniques (KASRET) is proposed that helps during RE techniques selection. This approach has three major features. First, a library of requirements techniques was developed which includes detailed knowledge about RE techniques. Second, KASRET integrates advantages of different knowledge representation schemata and reasoning mechanisms. Thus, KASRET provides mechanisms for the management of knowledge about requirements techniques and support for RE process development. Third, as a major decision support mechanism, an objective function evaluates the overall ability and cost of RE techniques, which is helpful for the selection of RE techniques. This paper makes not only a contribution to RE but also to research and application of knowledge management and decision support in process development. A case study using an industrial project shows the support of KASRET for RE techniques selection.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-007-0060-2,,"['Knowledge management', 'Reasoning', 'Requirements engineering', 'Techniques', 'Evaluation', 'Decision support']",13Citations,Springer,,Li Jiang,Armin Eberlein,Behrouz H.

Clear justification of modeling decisions for goal-oriented requirements engineering,,"Information Management Research Unit (IMRU), University of Namur, 8, rempart de la vierge, 5000, Namur, Belgium",09-Oct-07,"AbstractRepresentation and reasoning about goals of an information system unavoidably involve the transformation of unclear stakeholder requirements into an instance of a goal model. If the requirements engineer does not justify why one clear form of requirements is chosen over others, the subsequent modeling decisions cannot be justified either. If arguments for clarification and modeling decisions are instead explicit, justifiably appropriate instances of goal models can be constructed and additional analyses applied to discover richer sets of requirements. The paper proposes the “Goal Argumentation Method (GAM)” to fulfil three roles: (i) GAM guides argumentation and justification of modeling choices during the construction or critique of goal model instances; (ii) it enables the detection of deficient argumentation within goal model instances; and (iii) it provides practical techniques for the engineer to ensure that requirements appearing both in arguments and in model instance elements are clear.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-007-0056-y,,"['Goal modeling', 'Argumentation', 'Clarification', 'Goal-oriented requirements engineering']",38Citations,Springer,,Ivan J.

Sensitivity analysis in the process of COTS mismatch-handling,,"Shoubra Faculty of Engineering, Banha University, 108 Shoubra St, Cairo, Egypt",29-Jan-08,"AbstractDuring the selection of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products, mismatches encountered between stakeholders’ requirements and features offered by COTS products are inevitable. These mismatches occur as a result of an excess or shortage of functionality offered by the COTS. A decision support approach, called mismatch handling for COTS selection (MiHOS), was proposed earlier to help address mismatches while considering limited resources. In MiHOS, several input parameters need to be estimated such as the level of mismatches and the resource consumptions and constraints. These estimates are subject to uncertainty and therefore limit the applicability of the results. In this paper, we propose sensitivity analysis for MiHOS (MiHOS-SA), an approach that aims at helping decision makers gain insights into the impact of input uncertainties on the validity of MiHOS’ results. MiHOS-SA draws on existing sensitivity analysis techniques to address the problem. A case study from the e-services domain was conducted to illustrate MiHOS-SA and discuss its added value.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-008-0062-8,,"['COTS vs. requirements mismatch', 'COTS selection', 'MiHOS', 'Sensitivity analysis', 'Case study']",4Citations,Springer,,Abdallah Mohamed,Guenther Ruhe,Armin Eberlein,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-008-0062-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
MOQARE: misuse-oriented quality requirements engineering,,"Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Software Engineering Group, University of Heidelberg, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany",25-Sep-07,"AbstractThis work presents MOQARE (misuse-oriented quality requirements engineering), a method to explore quality requirements. The aim of MOQARE is to support intuitive and systematic identification of quality requirements. It was developed by integrating and adapting concepts from other methods (like Misuse Cases). It provides a general conceptual model of quality requirements, and a checklist-based process for deriving them in a top-down fashion. This derivation starts from business goals and vague quality requirements and delivers detailed requirements. MOQARE applies to requirements on the system to be developed requirements, but also derives requirements on the development process, including administration and maintenance. It considers normal and extreme use. The relationships among these requirements are modeled in a Misuse Tree.

An approach to engineering the requirements of data warehouses,,"GCET, 1 Knowledge Park Phase II, Greater Noida, 201306, Uttar Pradesh, India",16-Oct-07,"AbstractWe focus exclusively on the issue of Requirements engineering for Data Warehouses (DW). Our position is that the information content of a DW is found in the larger context of the goals of an organization. We refer to this context as the organizational perspective. Goals identify the set of decisions that are relevant which in turn help in determining the information needed to support these. The organizational perspective is converted into the technical perspective, which deals with the set of decisions to be supported and the information required. The latter defines Data warehouse contents. To elicit the technical perspective, we use the notion of an informational scenario. It is a typical interaction between a DW system and the decision maker and consists of a sequence of pairs of the form, <information request, response>. We formulate an information request as a statement in an adapted form of SQL called Specification SQL. The proposals here are implemented in the form of an Informational Scenario Engine that processes informational scenarios and determines Data Warehouse Information Contents.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-007-0057-x,,"['Requirement Engineering', 'Data Warehouse', 'Organizational Goal', 'Requirement Engineer', 'Organizational View']",45Citations,Springer,,Naveen Prakash,Anjana Gosain,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-007-0057-x,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

The paper describes a comprehensive process that can enable product development teams to deal with statements of product requirements, as originally collected through market research activities, in a systematic and traceable manner from the early, fuzzy front end, stages of the design process. The process described has been based on principles of systems engineering. A case study from its application and evaluation drawn from the power sector is described in this paper. The case study demonstrates how the process can significantly improve product quality planning practices through revision of captured product requirements, analysis of stakeholder requirements and derivation of design requirements. The paper discusses benefits and issues from the use of the process by product development teams, and identifies areas for further research.

Generating Natural Language specifications from UML class diagrams,,"Informatics Research Institute, Newton Building, University of Salford, Salford, M5 4WT, UK",25-Sep-07,"AbstractEarly phases of software development are known to be problematic, difficult to manage and errors occurring during these phases are expensive to correct. Many systems have been developed to aid the transition from informal Natural Language requirements to semi-structured or formal specifications. Furthermore, consistency checking is seen by many software engineers as the solution to reduce the number of errors occurring during the software development life cycle and allow early verification and validation of software systems. However, this is confined to the models developed during analysis and design and fails to include the early Natural Language requirements. This excludes proper user involvement and creates a gap between the original requirements and the updated and modified models and implementations of the system. To improve this process, we propose a system that generates Natural Language specifications from UML class diagrams. We first investigate the variation of the input language used in naming the components of a class diagram based on the study of a large number of examples from the literature and then develop rules for removing ambiguities in the subset of Natural Language used within UML. We use WordNet, a linguistic ontology, to disambiguate the lexical structures of the UML string names and generate semantically sound sentences.

Design and implementation of a smart system for personalization and accurate selection of mobile services,,"Department of Computing and Information Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada, N1G 2W1",17-Jul-07,"AbstractWireless mobile services are computing applications that run on handheld wireless devices. Such applications must work within the daunting constraints of the devices, which include memory, processing power, input capabilities, and size of display. It is therefore important that mobile services take into account the user’s context, optimize resource usage, and minimize input effort imposed on the user. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a smart agent-enabled system for personalizing wireless mobile services and advertisements for Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) or Java ME, and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) enabled devices. We use software agents for context filtering because such autonomous software entities have characteristics that can benefit mobile devices and the wireless environment, and the Composite Capability/Preference Profiles (CC/PP) standard for defining profiles for user preferences and device capabilities. The system incorporates the use of artificial neural networks to adaptively and iteratively learn to select the best available service based on contextual information. The system is evaluated using practical operating scenarios, as well as empirical data and results show an 87% success rate in the selection of the best available service.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-007-0051-3,,"['Mobile services', 'Software agents', 'CC/PP', 'Personalization', 'WAP', 'J2ME', 'Java ME', 'Service selection', 'Artificial neural networks']",6Citations,Springer,,Qusay H.

Industry evaluation of the Requirements Abstraction Model,,"School of Engineering, Blekinge Institute of Technology, P.O. Box 520, 372-25, Ronneby, Sweden",03-May-07,"AbstractSoftware requirements are often formulated on different levels and hence they are difficult to compare to each other. To address this issue, a model that allows for placing requirements on different levels has been developed. The model supports both abstraction and refinement of requirements, and hence requirements can both be compared with each other and to product strategies. Comparison between requirements will allow for prioritization of requirements, which in many cases is impossible if the requirements are described on different abstraction levels. Comparison to product strategies will enable early and systematic acceptance or dismissal of requirements, minimizing the risk for overloading. This paper presents an industrial evaluation of the model. It has been evaluated in two different companies, and the experiences and findings are presented.

Requirement progression in problem frames: deriving specifications from requirements,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Software Design Group, 32 Vassar Street, 32-G707, Cambridge, MA, 02148, USA",12-Apr-07,"AbstractA technique is presented for obtaining a specification from a requirement through a series of incremental steps. The starting point is a Problem Frame description, involving a decomposition of the environment into interconnected domains and a formal requirement on phenomena of those domains. In each step, the requirement is moved towards the machine, leaving behind a trail of “breadcrumbs”—partial domain descriptions representing assumptions about the behaviors of those domains. Eventually, the transformed requirement references only phenomena at the interface of the machine and can therefore serve as a specification. Each step is justified by a mechanically checkable implication, ensuring that, if the machine obeys the derived specification and the domain assumptions are valid, the requirement will hold. The technique is formalized in Alloy and demonstrated on two examples.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-007-0048-y,,"['Road Segment', 'Traffic Light', 'Problem Frame', 'Domain Property', 'Alloy Analyzer']",36Citations,Springer,,Robert Seater,Daniel Jackson,Rohit Gheyi,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-007-0048-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Multi-level feature trees,,"Technische Universität Berlin, Fakultät IV, Lehrstuhl Softwaretechnik, Franklinstrasse 28/29, 10587, Berlin, Germany",11-Apr-07,"AbstractFeature modeling has become a popular technique for domain analysis and variability management. However, it is still a considerable challenge to apply this technique to product families and organizational contexts of high complexity like the product range of a global automotive corporation. Managing everything as a single product family with a global feature tree is virtually impossible owing to the enormous complexity, but if the product range is split up into several smaller, independent product lines with separate feature models, systematic reuse and strategic variability management across these portions is lost. In this article, we present multi-level feature trees, which offer a compromise between a single global and several smaller, independent feature trees. Other development artifacts may also be arranged in this way if the multi-level concept is adapted to them. This is shown exemplarily for requirements artifacts in Telelogic Doors. Finally, we describe scenarios showing how this concept can be put into practice.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-007-0046-0,,"['Software product lines', 'Domain analysis', 'Requirements engineering', 'Automotive software']",51Citations,Springer,,Mark-Oliver Reiser,Matthias Weber,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-007-0046-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Automated classification of non-functional requirements ,,"Center for Requirements Engineering, School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems, DePaul University, 243 S. Wabash Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60604, USA",23-Mar-07,"AbstractThis paper describes a technique for automating the detection and classification of non-functional requirements related to properties such as security, performance, and usability. Early detection of non-functional requirements enables them to be incorporated into the initial architectural design instead of being refactored in at a later date. The approach is used to detect and classify stakeholders’ quality concerns across requirements specifications containing scattered and non-categorized requirements, and also across freeform documents such as meeting minutes, interview notes, and memos. This paper first describes the classification algorithm and then evaluates its effectiveness through reporting a series of experiments based on 30 requirements specifications developed as term projects by MS students at DePaul University. A new and iterative approach is then introduced for training or retraining a classifier to detect and classify non-functional requirements (NFR) in datasets dissimilar to the initial training sets. This approach is evaluated against a large free-form requirements document obtained from Siemens Logistics and Automotive Organization. Although to the NFR classifier is unable to detect all of the NFRs, it is useful for supporting an analyst in the error-prone task of manually discovering NFRs, and furthermore can be used to quickly analyse large and complex documents in order to search for NFRs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-007-0045-1,,"['Non-functional requirements', 'Quality requirements', 'Classification', 'Early aspects']",171Citations,Springer,,Jane Cleland-Huang,Raffaella Settimi,Xuchang Zou,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-007-0045-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Analogy-based domain analysis approach to software reuse,,"Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, K1S 5B6, Ottawa, ON, Canada",05-May-06,"AbstractDomain analysis is an expansion of conventional requirements analysis. Domain analysis can support effective software reuse. However, domain analysis is time consuming and is limited to a particular application area. Analogical approaches to software reuse, on the other hand, often occur across domains. Analogical problem solving is a process of transferring knowledge from a well-understood base domain to a new target problem area. Analogy can facilitate software reuse for poorly understood problems or new application areas. Analogy shares similar concepts with reuse and some analogy theories have been applied to software reuse. However, current research on software analogy often overlooks the importance of analysis for the base domain and does not consider some critical aspects of analogy concepts. Reuse must be based on high quality artifacts, especially reuse across domains. This paper presents an approach to integrate domain analysis and analogy methods. In our view, domain analysis and software analogy have complementary roles. Domain analysis is regarded as a process to identify and supply necessary information for analogical transfer. Software analogy can provide the analyst with similar problems and solutions to reuse previous domain analysis knowledge or artifacts for a new domain. This paper presents case studies to demonstrate the increase of efficiency in applying the approach. Evaluation of the approach from various perspectives is also reported.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-006-0035-8,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Domain analysis', 'Software analogy', 'Software reuse']",4Citations,Springer,,Chung-Horng Lung,Joseph E.

Using obstacle analysis to identify contingency requirements on an unpiloted aerial vehicle,,"JPL/Caltech and Iowa State University, 226 Atanasoff Hall, Ames, IA, 50011, USA",31-Oct-06,"AbstractThis paper describes the use of Obstacle Analysis to identify anomaly handling requirements for a safety-critical, autonomous system. The software requirements for the system evolved during operations due to an on-going effort to increase the autonomous system’s robustness. The resulting increase in autonomy also increased system complexity. This investigation used Obstacle Analysis to identify and to reason incrementally about new requirements for handling failures and other anomalous events. Results reported in the paper show that Obstacle Analysis complemented standard safety-analysis techniques in identifying undesirable behaviors and ways to resolve them. The step-by-step use of Obstacle Analysis identified potential side effects and missing monitoring and control requirements. Adding an Availability Indicator and feature-interaction patterns proved useful for the analysis of obstacle resolutions.

Requirements engineering in health care: the example of chemotherapy planning in paediatric oncology,,"Health Informatics Research Group, Faculty of Business and Informatics, Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, QLD, 4702, Australia",21-Feb-06,"AbstractHealth care is characterized by highly complex processes of patient care that require unusual amount of communication between different health care professionals of different institutions. Sub-optimal processes can significantly impact on the patient’s health, increase the consumption of services and resources and in severe cases can lead to the patient death. For these reasons, requirements engineering for the development of information technology in health care is a complex process as well: without constant and rigorous evaluation, the impact of new systems on the quality of care is unknown and it is possible that badly designed systems significantly harm patients. To overcome these limitations, we present and discuss an approach to requirements engineering that we applied for the development of applications for chemotherapy planning in paediatric oncology. Chemotherapy planning in paediatric oncology is complex and time-consuming and errors must be avoided by all means. In the multi-hospital/multi-trial-centre environment of paediatric oncology, it is especially difficult and time-consuming to analyse requirements. Our approach combines a grounded theory approach with evolutionary prototyping based on the constant development and refinement of a generic domain model, in this case a domain model for chemotherapy planning in paediatric oncology. The prototypes were introduced in medical centres and final results show that the developed generic domain model is adequate.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-006-0029-6,,"['Requirements engineering', 'Chemotherapy planning', 'Paediatric oncology', 'Grounded theory', 'UML']",25Citations,Springer,,Sebastian Garde,Petra Knaup,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-006-0029-6,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
On generic method models,,"JUIT, 173215, Waknaghat, Himachal Pradesh, India",10-Mar-06,"AbstractThe generic method model assumes that methods abound and method engineering and application engineering is done in diverse areas. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the notion of a method independent of information systems and software engineering. The generic model presented here abstracts out from product and process meta-models to define a system of concepts that can be used in any domain. Additionally, it integrates in it essential features of methods like quality checking, guidance, backtracking, and traceability. The proposed generic model looks upon a method in two parts, the static and the dynamic parts. The former provides the basic structure of a method whereas the latter is the enactment support provided for application development. The static part provides the notion of method blocks and dependencies between them. Method blocks can be enacted. The generic model is a triple <M, D, E> where M is the set of method blocks, D is the set of dependencies between method blocks, and E is the enactment mechanism.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-005-0026-1,,"['Dependency Graph', 'Product Part', 'Application Engineer', 'Dependency Type', 'Method Block']",10Citations,Springer,,Naveen Prakash,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-005-0026-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

We apply both of these lists to two samples drawn from the set of all submissions to the RE’03 conference. Analysis of these two samples shows that most submissions of the RE’03 conference are design papers, not research papers, and that most design papers present a solution to a problem but neither validate this solution nor investigate the problems that can be solved by this solution.

Articulation of information requirements for personalised knowledge construction,,"Informatics Research Centre, The University of Reading, Reading, UK",21-Apr-06,"AbstractThe quality of information provision influences considerably knowledge construction driven by individual users’ needs. In the design of information systems for e-learning, personal information requirements should be incorporated to determine a selection of suitable learning content, instructive sequencing for learning content, and effective presentation of learning content. This is considered as an important part of instructional design for a personalised information package. The current research reveals that there is a lack of means by which individual users’ information requirements can be effectively incorporated to support personal knowledge construction. This paper presents a method which enables an articulation of users’ requirements based on the rooted learning theories and requirements engineering paradigms. The user’s information requirements can be systematically encapsulated in a user profile (i.e. user requirements space), and further transformed onto instructional design specifications (i.e. information space). These two spaces allow the discovering of information requirements patterns for self-maintaining and self-adapting personalisation that enhance experience in the knowledge construction process.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-006-0031-z,,"['Requirements articulation', 'Personalised information provision', 'Knowledge construction', 'User profiling', 'Information space']",9Citations,Springer,,Lily Sun,Khadidjatou Ousmanou,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-006-0031-z,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Guidelines for the incremental identification of aspects in requirements specifications,,"Department of Telematics Engineering, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain",03-Mar-06,"AbstractThe desired principle of separation of concerns in software development can be jeopardized by the so-called crosscutting concerns, which tend to be scattered over (and tangled with) the functionality of the modular units of a system. The correct identification of such concerns (and their encapsulation into separate artifacts) is thereby considered a way to improve software understanding and evolution. Pursuing a proper management of concerns from the requirements engineering stage can greatly benefit the entire software life-cycle. In this paper, we propose conceptual guidelines on how to perform the identification of crosscutting concerns in the process of building requirements specifications. We argue that the identification must be carried out in an incremental way, to encapsulate apart the crosscutting concerns even if they have not emerged completely yet.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-006-0028-7,,"['Crosscutting concerns', 'Incremental software development', 'Requirements specifications', 'Aspect-mining']",5Citations,Springer,,Jorge García-Duque,Martín López-Nores,José J.

View merging in the presence of incompleteness and inconsistency,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, M5S 3G4",03-May-06,"AbstractView merging, also called view integration, is a key problem in conceptual modeling. Large models are often constructed and accessed by manipulating individual views, but it is important to be able to consolidate a set of views to gain a unified perspective, to understand interactions between views, or to perform various types of analysis. View merging is complicated by incompleteness and inconsistency: Stakeholders often have varying degrees of confidence about their statements. Their views capture different but overlapping aspects of a problem, and may have discrepancies over the terminology being used, the concepts being modeled, or how these concepts should be structured. Once views are merged, it is important to be able to trace the elements of the merged view back to their sources and to the merge assumptions related to them. In this paper, we present a framework for merging incomplete and inconsistent graph-based views. We introduce a formalism, called annotated graphs, with a built-in annotation scheme for modeling incompleteness and inconsistency. We show how structure-preserving maps can be employed to express the relationships between disparate views modeled as annotated graphs, and provide a general algorithm for merging views with arbitrary interconnections. We provide a systematic way to generate and represent the traceability information required for tracing the merged view elements back to their sources, and to the merge assumptions giving rise to the elements.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-006-0032-y,,"['Model management', 'View-based development', 'View merging', 'Inconsistency management']",73Citations,Springer,,Mehrdad Sabetzadeh,Steve Easterbrook,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-006-0032-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
PC-RE: a method for personal and contextual requirements engineering with some experience,,"Centre for HCI Design, School of Informatics, University of Manchester, P.O.Box 88,  M60 1QD,  Manchester, UK",14-Mar-06,"AbstractA method for requirements analysis is proposed that accounts for individual and personal goals, and the effect of time and context on personal requirements. First a framework to analyse the issues inherent in requirements that change over time and location is proposed. The implications of the framework on system architecture are considered as three implementation pathways: functional specifications, development of customisable features and automatic adaptation by the system. These pathways imply the need to analyse system architecture requirements. A scenario-based analysis method is described for specifying requirements goals and their potential change. The method addresses goal setting for measurement and monitoring, and conflict resolution when requirements at different layers (group, individual) and from different sources (personal, advice from an external authority) conflict. The method links requirements analysis to design by modelling alternative solution pathways. Different implementation pathways have cost–benefit implications for stakeholders, so cost–benefit analysis techniques are proposed to assess trade-offs between goals and implementation strategies. The use of the framework is illustrated with two case studies in assistive technology domains: e-mail and a personalised navigation system. The first case study illustrates personal requirements to help cognitively disabled users communicate via e-mail, while the second addresses personal and mobile requirements to help disabled users make journeys on their own, assisted by a mobile PDA guide. In both case studies the experience from requirements analysis to implementation, requirements monitoring, and requirements evolution is reported.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-006-0030-0,,"['Individual User', 'Assistive Technology', 'Personal Goal', 'User Characteristic', 'Goal Modelling']",55Citations,Springer,,Alistair Sutcliffe,Stephen Fickas,McKay Moore Sohlberg,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-006-0030-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A requirements engineering framework for cross-organizational ERP systems,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Twente, Drienerlolaan 5, P.O. Box 217, 7500 AE, Enschede, The Netherlands",05-May-06,"AbstractThe development of cross-organizational enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions is becoming increasingly critical to the business strategy of many networked companies. The major function of cross-organizational ERP solutions is to coordinate work in two or more organizations. However, how to align ERP application components and business requirements for coordination and cooperation is hardly known. This paper reports on the outcomes of applying a coordination theory perspective to an analysis of the ERP misalignment problem. We present a conceptual framework for analyzing coordination and cooperation requirements in inter-organizational ERP projects. The framework makes explicit the undocumented built-in assumptions for coordination and cooperation that may have significant implications for the ERP adopters and incorporates a library of existing coordination mechanisms supported by modern ERP systems. We use it to develop a proposal for how to achieve a better alignment between ERP implementations and supported business coordination processes in inter-organizational settings. We report on some early assessments of the implications of our framework for practicing requirements engineers. Both our framework and library rest on a literature survey and the first author’s experience with ERP implementation.

COTS tenders and integration requirements,,"IT University of Copenhagen, Rued Langgaardsvej 7, 2300, Copenhagen S, Denmark",13-Dec-05,"AbstractWhen buying COTS-based software, the customer has to choose between what is available. The supplier may add some minor parts, but rarely everything the customer wants. This means that the customer cannot write down his requirements and expect that they can all be met. A scoring system is necessary rather than traditional mandatory requirements. Requirements for integrating the new COTS system with other systems are particularly hard because suppliers may integrate in different ways and with different other systems. A related problem is that once the new COTS system is purchased, the COTS supplier may have a de facto monopoly. Only he can expand the system or integrate it with other systems. The traditional way to purchase COTS is to iteratively find the right product. However, in a tender process this is not possible, and another solution is necessary. Experience shows that customers fail to deal with these issues adequately. As an example they may believe that asking for open interfaces is sufficient to guard them against monopoly. In this paper we analyze the problems and show ways to deal with them. We illustrate the problems and solutions with real-life examples from electronic patient recording systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-005-0022-5,,"['COTS', 'Tender process', 'Integration requirements', 'Risk reduction', 'Open-target requirements', 'Supplier monopoly', 'Third-party requirements']",9Citations,Springer,,Søren Lauesen,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-005-0022-5,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Goal and scenario validation: a fluent combination,,"Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK",20-Dec-05,"AbstractScenarios and goals are effective techniques for requirements definition. Goals are objectives that a system has to meet. They are elaborated into a structure that decomposes declarative goals into goals that can be formulated in terms of events and can be controlled or monitored by the system. Scenarios are operational examples of system usage. Validation of goals and scenarios is essential in order to ensure that they represent what stakeholders actually want. Rather than validating scenarios and goals separately, possibly driving the elaboration of one through the validation of another, this paper exploits the relationship between goals and scenarios. The aim is to provide effective graphical animations as a means of supporting such a validation. The relation between scenarios and goals is established by means of fluents that describe how events of the operational description change the state of the basic propositions from which goals are expressed. Graphical animations are specified in terms of fluents and driven by a behaviour model synthesised from the operational scenarios. In addition, goal model checking over operational scenarios is provided to guide animations through goal violation traces.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-005-0024-3,,"['Fluent Expression', 'Concrete State', 'System Goal', 'Visual Element', 'Enterprise Resource Planning System']",14Citations,Springer,,Sebastian Uchitel,Robert Chatley,Jeff Kramer,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-005-0024-3,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

We leverage the paradigm of projection in both approaches as a means of simultaneously decomposing both the requirement and context parts, from an abstract business level to concrete system requirements.

Requirements quality control: a unifying framework,,"University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland",07-Oct-05,"AbstractLiterature tends to discuss software (and system) requirements quality control, which includes validation and verification, as a heterogeneous process using a great variety of relatively independent techniques. Also, process-oriented thinking prevails. In this paper, we attempt to promote the point that this important activity must be studied as a coherent entity. It cannot be seen as a rather mechanical process of checking documents either. Validation, especially, is more an issue of communicating requirements, as constructed by the analysts, back to the stakeholders whose goals those requirements are supposed to meet, and to all those other stakeholders, with whose goals those requirements may conflict. The main problem, therefore, is that of achieving a sufficient level of understanding of the stated requirements by a particular stakeholder, which may be hindered by, for example, lack of technical expertise. In this paper, we develop a unifying framework for requirements quality control. We reorganize the existing knowledge around the issue of communicating requirements to all the different stakeholders, instead of just focusing on some techniques and processes. We hope that this framework could clarify thinking in the area, and make future research a little more focused.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-005-0018-1,,"['Requirement Engineer', 'Requirement Document', 'Requirement Validation', 'Software Requirement Specification', 'Reading Technique']",26Citations,Springer,,Artem Katasonov,Markku Sakkinen,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-005-0018-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Requirements Abstraction Model,,"School of Engineering, Blekinge Institute of Technology, PO Box 520, 372 25, Ronneby, Sweden",26-Nov-05,"AbstractSoftware requirements arrive in different shapes and forms to development organizations. This is particularly the case in market-driven requirements engineering, where the requirements are on products rather than directed towards projects. This results in challenges related to making different requirements comparable. In particular, this situation was identified in a collaborative effort between academia and industry. A model, with four abstraction levels, was developed as a response to the industrial need. The model allows for placement of requirements on different levels and supports abstraction or break down of requirements to make them comparable to each other. The model was successfully validated in several steps at a company. The results from the industrial validation point to the usefulness of the model. The model will allow companies to ensure comparability between requirements, and hence it generates important input to activities such as prioritization and packaging of requirements before launching a development project.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-005-0020-7,,"['Market-driven product-centered continuous requirements engineering', 'Requirements abstraction', 'Product management', 'Product strategy']",134Citations,Springer,,Tony Gorschek,Claes Wohlin,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-005-0020-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A requirements monitoring framework for enterprise systems,,"Management Information Systems, College of Business, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, 97331-2603, USA",23-Nov-05,"AbstractRequirements compliant software is becoming a necessity. Fewer and fewer organizations will run their critical transactions on software that has no visible relationship to its requirements. Businesses wish to see their software being consistent with their policies. Moreover, partnership agreements are pressuring less mature organizations to improve their systems. Businesses that rely on web services, for example, are vulnerable to the problems of their web service providers. While electronic commerce has increased the speed of on-line transactions, the technology for monitoring requirements compliance—especially for transactions—has lagged behind. To address the requirements monitoring problem for enterprise information systems, we integrate techniques for requirements analysis and software execution monitoring. Our framework assists analysts in the development of requirements monitors for enterprise services. The deployed system raises alerts when services succeed or fail to satisfy their specified requirements, thereby making software requirements visible. The framework usage is demonstrated with an analysis of ebXML marketplace specifications. An analyst applies goal analysis to discover potential service obstacles, and then derives requirements monitors and a distributed monitoring system. Once deployed, the monitoring system provides alerts when obstacles occur. A summary of the framework implementation is presented, along with analysis of two monitor component implementations. We conclude that the approach implemented in the framework, called ReqMon, provides real-time feedback on requirements satisfaction, and thereby provides visibility into requirements compliance of enterprise information systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-005-0016-3,,"['Requirements monitoring', 'Web services', 'CASE', 'Electronic commerce']",111Citations,Springer,,William N.

Situational method engineering: combining assembly-based and roadmap-driven approaches,,"Laboratoire I3S, Les Algorithmes, Route des Lucioles, BP 121, 06903, Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France",03-Nov-05,"AbstractBecause the engineering situation of each information system development (ISD) project is different, engineering methods need to be adapted, transformed or enhanced to satisfy the specific project situation. Contributions, in the field of situational method engineering (SME), aim at providing techniques and tools allowing to construct project-specific methods instead of looking for universally applicable ones. In addition to the engineering method tailoring, necessary to fit the project situation, a customization of the engineering method for each engineer participating in the project is also required. Such a configuration allows a better understanding of the method by focusing on guidelines related to the project engineer’s daily tasks. It also increases his/her involvement in the ISD method realization. To achieve this twofold objective (ISD method tailoring and customization), we propose a framework for SME combining an assembly-based approach for project-specific method construction and a roadmap-driven approach for engineer-specific method configuration. The first step of our process provides support to build a new method that is most suitable for the current ISD project situation, whereas the second step aims at choosing the most adapted path (roadmap) to satisfy the requirements of a particular project engineer within the project-specific method. The two core elements of our SME framework are the method chunks repository and the reuse frame. The former concerns reusable method components definition and storage whereas the latter deals with the characterization of the project situation and the project engineer’s profile. In this paper we start first by presenting our SME framework and its core elements: the method chunk repository and the reuse frame. Then we show how to take advantage of them through our two-step process combining assembly-based method construction and roadmap-driven method configuration.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-005-0019-0,,"['Crew Member', 'Problem Context', 'Requirement Elicitation', 'Information System Development', 'Method Engineer']",117Citations,Springer,,Isabelle Mirbel,Jolita Ralyté,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-005-0019-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Applying a pragmatics-based creativity-fostering technique to requirements elicitation,,"Department of Computer and Telecommunication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy",30-Sep-05,"AbstractThis paper proposes the application to requirements elicitation of an innovative creativity fostering technique based on a model of the pragmatics of communication, the Elementary Pragmatic Model (EPM). The EPM has been used to define a creative process, called EPMcreate (EPM Creative Requirements Engineering TEchnique) that consists of sixteen steps. In each step, the problem is analyzed according to one elementary behavior identified by the EPM. Each behavior suggests that the analyst look at the problem from a different combination of users’ viewpoints. The feasibility and effectiveness of the technique in requirements elicitation was demonstrated by experiments on two projects with very different characteristics. Each experiment compared the performances of two analysis teams, one of which used EPMcreate and the other of which used brainstorming. The results of both experiments highlights the higher effectiveness of EPMcreate. Additional data from the experiments are examined for other insights into how and why EPMcreate is effective.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-005-0008-3,,"['Exploratory experiment', 'Pragmatics of communication', 'Problem solving', 'Viewpoint']",52Citations,Springer,,Luisa Mich,Cinzia Anesi,Daniel M.

The paper reports the results of this application and describes them with examples, the benefits of the approach to the project, and ongoing research to implement these patterns in the REDEPEND modelling tool to make requirements engineers more productive.

Communication gaps in a tender process,,"IT University of Copenhagen, Rued Langgaardsvej 7, 2300, Copenhagen S, Denmark",19-Aug-05,"AbstractLarge IT systems are often acquired in a tender process where the customer states the system requirements, a number of suppliers submit their proposals, and the customer selects one of them. Usually the supplier uses an existing system as the basis for his proposal. He adapts it more or less to the customer’s requirements. This paper is a study of a specific tender process. The customer was a Danish municipality that supplied electrical power, water, gas, garbage collection, etc. for around 100,000 households. The customer wanted a new system for meter inspection, invoicing, planning the meter inspector’s routes, etc. We have studied the requirements, how they were perceived by the suppliers, and how they were intended by the customer. The main findings are that the parties didn’t understand each other, although the suppliers sometimes pretended that they did so. One consequence was that the business goals pursued by the customer were not properly achieved. Among the causes of this were an excessively democratic elicitation process and an inadequate use of requirement techniques, particularly use cases. There were also issues that the existing requirement techniques couldn’t deal with, for instance integration with future systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-005-0009-2,,"['COTS', 'Tender process', 'Business goals', 'Software requirements', 'Integration requirements', 'Use cases', 'Task and support']",7Citations,Springer,,Søren Lauesen,Jens Peder Vium,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-005-0009-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Improving the detection of requirements discordances among stakeholders,,"Graduate School of Information Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 152-8552, Japan",10-Nov-05,"AbstractThis paper introduces a technique to identify requirements discordances among stakeholders. This technique is validated in experiments. An extended version of the goal-oriented requirements elicitation method, named attributed goal-oriented analysis (AGORA), and its supporting tool are used. Two types of requirements discordances among stakeholders are defined: the first arises from the different interpretations by the stakeholders and the second is the result of different evaluations of preferences. Discordances are detected by the preference matrices in AGORA. Each preference matrix represents both preferences of each stakeholder and the estimated preferences of other stakeholders. A supporting tool for the AGORA method was developed. This tool is a groupware that seamlessly combines face-to-face meetings for goal elicitation and distributed individual sessions for scoring preference values. The experimental results showed that the proposed classification of discordances was sound and that the occurrences of the requirements discordances could be detected by preference matrices.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-005-0017-2,,"['Requirements elicitation', 'Goal-oriented analysis', 'Requirements discordances']",32Citations,Springer,,Haruhiko Kaiya,Daisuke Shinbara,Jinichi Kawano,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-005-0017-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Measuring the fitness relationship,,"CRI University Paris1, 90 rue de Tolbiac, 75013, Paris, France",19-Aug-05,"AbstractIt is widely acknowledged that the system functionality captured in a system model has to match organisational requirements available in the business model. However, such a matching is rarely used to support design strategies. We believe that appropriate measures of what we refer to as the fitness relationship can facilitate design decisions. The paper proposes criteria and associated generic metrics to quantify to which extent there is a fit between the business and the system which supports it. In order to formulate metrics independent of specific formalisms to express the system and the business models, we base our proposal on the use of ontologies. This also contributes to provide a theoretical foundation to our proposal.

Delta analysis with workflow logs: aligning business process prescriptions and their reality,,"DaimlerChrysler Research and Technology, Alt Moabit 96a, 10559, Berlin, Germany",27-Sep-05,"AbstractTo support and drive a business process with a software system means influencing the way process participants conduct their daily work. An analysis of the relationships between organizational processes, support systems, and process participants calls for a continuous alignment and parallel evolution of the intended business process and the supporting software system. Here, the primary information needed is how process participants work with the new system and where and why they deviate from the intended process. Delta analysis with workflow logs employs workflow logs recorded during system use to compare process enactment with its prescription: log entries are related with instances of business process activities of an explicit process definition, and the timely ordering of these entries is compared with the ordering of the activities implied by the process model. If the orderings comply, the log fits the model. Log entries and activities can be on arbitrary levels of abstraction and arbitrary granularity. The results of such an analysis can be utilized as an unbiased data basis for further discussions. Moreover, compared with traditional approaches such as interviews and observations, time and costs can be saved.

Business alignment: using process mining as a tool for Delta analysis and conformance testing,,"Department of Technology Management, Eindhoven University of Technology, P.O. Box 513, 5600MB, Eindhoven, The Netherlands",19-Aug-05,"AbstractIncreasingly, business processes are being controlled and/or monitored by information systems. As a result, many business processes leave their “footprints” in transactional information systems, i.e., business events are recorded in so-called event logs. Process mining aims at improving this by providing techniques and tools for discovering process, control, data, organizational, and social structures from event logs, i.e., the basic idea of process mining is to diagnose business processes by mining event logs for knowledge. In this paper we focus on the potential use of process mining for measuring business alignment, i.e., comparing the real behavior of an information system or its users with the intended or expected behavior. We identify two ways to create and/or maintain the fit between business processes and supporting information systems: Delta analysis and conformance testing. Delta analysis compares the discovered model (i.e., an abstraction derived from the actual process) with some predefined processes model (e.g., the workflow model or reference model used to configure the system). Conformance testing attempts to quantify the “fit” between the event log and some predefined processes model. In this paper, we show that Delta analysis and conformance testing can be used to analyze business alignment as long as the actual events are logged and users have some control over the process.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-005-0001-x,,"['Process mining', 'Business process management', 'Business alignment', 'Workflow management', 'Delta analysis', 'Conformance testing']",101Citations,Springer,,W.

Ontology based object-oriented domain modelling: fundamental concepts,,"School of Information Management, Victoria University of Wellington, Box 600, Wellington, New Zealand",13-Jan-05,"AbstractUnderstanding the business is an important step in information system (IS) development. Conceptual models are descriptions of the organizational context for which a system is developed, and are used to help understanding this context. However, conceptual modelling methods do not provide well-formalized ways to create domain descriptions. On the other hand, in the area of IS design and software modelling, languages exist (such as UML) that possess a high level of formality. Extending the use of these IS design languages to conceptual modelling, even though they have not been specifically intended for this, can lead to several advantages. In particular, it can enable the use of similar notation in several stages of system development. However, while object-oriented constructs such as “object” and “operation” have clear meaning in the context of software design, it is not clear what they might mean in terms of the application domain, and no rules or guidelines exist for using them to create useful descriptions of such domains. This paper suggests specific semantics for object-oriented constructs based on a mapping between ontologically derived concepts and object-oriented language constructs. The paper also proposes modelling rules to guide the construction of object-oriented conceptual models and to assure that such models describe only ontologically feasible application domain situations. While the results are applicable to object-oriented constructs in general, UML is used as an example. A case study to test the use of the proposed semantics and modelling rules is described.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-004-0208-2,,"['Object-oriented modelling', 'System analysis', 'Business analysis', 'UML', 'Ontology']",72Citations,Springer,,Joerg Evermann,Yair Wand,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-004-0208-2,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Success in a software project is influenced by the quality of requirements and their associated analysis since their outputs contribute to higher level design and verification decisions. Real-time software systems are event driven and contain temporal and resource limitation constraints. Natural-language-based specification and analysis of such systems are then limited to identifying functional and non-functional elements only. In order to design an architecture, or to be able to test and verify these systems, a comprehensive understanding of dependencies, concurrency, response times, and resource usage are necessary. Scenario-based analysis techniques provide a way to decompose requirements to understand the said attributes of real-time systems. However they are in themselves inadequate for providing support for all real-time attributes. This paper discusses and evaluates the suitability of certain scenario-based models in a real-time software environment and then proposes an approach, called timed automata, that constructs a formalised view of scenarios that generate timed specifications. This approach represents the operational view of scenarios with the support of a formal representation that is needed for real-time systems. Our results indicate that models with notations and semantic support for representing temporal and resource usage of scenario provide a better analysis domain.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-004-0192-6,,"['Real-time', 'Requirements engineering ', 'Scenario-based', 'Time-automata']",9Citations,Springer,,Hossein Saiedian,Prabha Kumarakulasingam,Muhammad Anan,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-004-0192-6,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
The system reliability analyser tool,,"Centre for HCI, Department of Computation, UMIST, Manchester, M60 1QD, UK",07-Oct-04,"AbstractThis paper describes the design and evaluation of a socio-technical design support system, the system reliability analyser (SRA). The tool is used to validate non-functional system requirements, such as system reliability. It employs a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model to assess system reliability (Pearl in Probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems: networks of plausible information, 1988) based on a variety of high-level operational scenarios. The tool diagnoses problematic areas in future system models and assists in the identification of their causes. The evaluation of the tool demonstrated that it supported the task it was intended to do.

An operational model for structuring the requirements generation process,,"Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, 24061-0106, USA",24-Jun-04,"AbstractProduct quality is directly related to how well that product meets the customer’s needs and intents. Therefore, the ability to capture customer requirements correctly and succinctly is paramount. Unfortunately, within most software development frameworks requirements elicitation, recording and evaluation are some of the more ill-defined and least structured activities. To help address such inadequacies, we propose a requirements generation model (RGM) that (a) decomposes the conventional “requirements analysis” phase into sub-phases which focus and refine requirement generation activities, (b) bounds and structures those activities to promote a more effective generation process, and (c) implements a monitoring methodology to assist in detecting deviations from well-defined procedures intended to support the generation of requirements that meet the customer’s intent. The RGM incorporates “lessons learned” from a preliminary study that concentrated on identifying where and how miscommunication and requirements omission occur. An industry study (also reported in this paper) attests to the effectiveness of the RGM. The results of that study indicate that the RGM helps (a) reduce the late discovery of requirements, (b) reduce the slippage in milestone completion dates, and (c) increase customer and management satisfaction levels.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-004-0196-2,,"['Requirements identification', 'Requirements generation', 'Customer intent', 'Requirements engineering', 'Software engineering', 'Software methodology']",16Citations,Springer,,James D.

Are use case and class diagrams complementary in requirements analysis? An experimental study on use case and class diagrams in UML,,"Department of Management, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 209 College of Business Administration, Lincoln, NE, 68588-0491, USA",07-Oct-04,"AbstractDespite the status of united modeling language (UML) as the de facto standard for object oriented modeling, it has received controversial reviews. The most controversial diagram in UML is the use case diagram. Some practitioners claim that use case diagrams are not valuable in requirements analysis and some have even argued that use case diagrams should not be part of UML. This research examined the values of use case diagram in interpreting requirements when use case diagrams are used in conjunction with class diagrams. In other words, the study investigated the possible synergetic values and relationships between the use case and class diagrams in the context of requirements analysis. This study used theories from cognitive psychology as its theoretical and conceptual foundation. The data collection utilized the verbal protocol technique in which subjects were asked to think aloud as they interpreted the use case and class diagrams. The results show that the use case diagrams were more completely interpreted than the class diagrams. The presence or absence of one diagram when interpreting another diagram had no effect on the outcome of the interpretation. From the results, we argue that the use case diagrams and class diagrams depict different aspects of the problem domain, they have very little overlap in the information captured, and both are necessary in requirements analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-004-0203-7,,"['Requirements analysis', 'Requirements engineering', 'Conceptual modeling', 'Unified modeling language', 'Use case diagram', 'Class diagram', 'Experimental study']",43Citations,Springer,,Keng Siau,Lihyunn Lee,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-004-0203-7,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

The hierarchy consists of simple and interrelated diagrams—ER structures—with external relationships to other structures. The HERD-tree diagram, which provides the most general view of the conceptual schema, is located at the top of the hierarchy. The method is based on packaging operations, which group entities and relationships according to certain criteria. These operations are applied in several steps on a given (presumably large-scale) ERD. We describe the new constructs, which are added to the ER model to enable the creation of HERD, and a bottom-up method for creating HERD.

The framework is based on the notion that modeling techniques should be compared via their underlying grammars. The framework identifies two types of dimensions in empirical comparisons—affecting and affected dimensions. The affecting dimensions provide guidance for task definition, independent variables and controls, while the affected dimensions define the possible mediating variables and dependent variables. In particular, the framework addresses the dependence between the modeling task—model creation and model interpretation—and the performance measures of the modeling grammar. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by using it to categorize existing work on evaluating modeling techniques. The paper also discusses theoretical foundations that can guide hypothesis generation and measurement of variables. Finally, the paper addresses possible levels for categorical variables and ways to measure interval variables, especially the grammar performance measures.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-004-0204-6,,"['System analysis and design', 'Information systems development', 'Conceptual modeling', 'Empirical comparison', 'Requirements engineering']",136Citations,Springer,,Andrew Gemino,Yair Wand,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-004-0204-6,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
The effect of the number of concepts on the readability of schemas: an empirical study with data models,,"The University of Tulsa,  600 South College, Tulsa, OK 74104,  U.S.A.",08-Oct-04,"AbstractThe number of concepts in a model has been frequently used in the literature to measure the ease of use in creating model schemas. However, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has looked at its effect on the readability of the model schemas after they have been created. The readability of a model schema is important in situations where the schemas are created by one team of analysts and read by other analysts, system developers, or maintenance administrators. Given the recent trend of models with increasing numbers of concepts such as the unified modeling language (UML), the effect of the number of concepts (NOC) on the readability of schemas has become increasingly important. In this work, we operationalize readability along three dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, and learnability. We draw on the Bunge Wand Weber (BWW) framework, as well as the signal detection recognition theory and the ACT theory from cognitive psychology to formulate hypotheses and conduct an experiment to study the effects of the NOC in a data model on these readability dimensions. Our work makes the following contributions: (a) it extends the operationalization of the readability construct, and (b) unlike earlier empirical work that has focused exclusively on comparing models that differ along several dimensions, this work proposes an empirical methodology that isolates the effect of a model-independent variable (the NOC) on readability. From a practical perspective, our findings have implications both for creators of new models, as well as for practitioners who use currently available models for creating schemas to communicate requirements during the entire lifecycle of a system.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-004-0202-8,,"['Treatment Level', 'Unify Modeling Language', 'Model Schema', 'Semantic Network', 'Successive Task']",12Citations,Springer,,Akhilesh Bajaj,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-004-0202-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

This paper describes RA’s taxonomy of relationship types and corresponding brainstorming questions for eliciting the relationship structure from a domain expert.

Results indicate how functionally similar packages can differ substantially in their technical quality and, thus, in their ability to be integrated within a company’s information system. The hierarchical model is verified to be dependable, since the quality-based ranking of packages is found to have a low rank-reversal probability as a consequence of managers’ uncertainty in weighing the relevance of different quality variables. From a practical standpoint, these results confirm that CRM packages differentiate in measurable quality variables, which can be used by practitioners as a framework to gather and evaluate software-selection information during feasibility analyses.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-003-0184-y,,"['Analytical hierarchy process (AHP)', 'Customer relationship management (CRM)', 'Software cost', 'Software selection']",33Citations,Springer,,Enzo Colombo,Chiara Francalanci,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-003-0184-y,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

A requirements taxonomy for reducing Web site privacy vulnerabilities,,"College of Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC , 27695-8207, USA",05-Dec-03,"AbstractThe increasing use of personal information on Web-based applications can result in unexpected disclosures. Consumers often have only the stated Web site policies as a guide to how their information is used, and thus on which to base their browsing and transaction decisions. However, each policy is different, and it is difficult—if not impossible—for the average user to compare and comprehend these policies. This paper presents a taxonomy of privacy requirements for Web sites. Using goal-mining, the extraction of pre-requirements goals from post-requirements text artefacts, we analysed an initial set of Internet privacy policies to develop the taxonomy. This taxonomy was then validated during a second goal extraction exercise, involving privacy policies from a range of health care related Web sites. This validation effort enabled further refinement to the taxonomy, culminating in two classes of privacy requirements: protection goals and vulnerabilities. Protection goals express the desired protection of consumer privacy rights, whereas vulnerabilities describe requirements that potentially threaten consumer privacy. The identified taxonomy categories are useful for analysing implicit internal conflicts within privacy policies, the corresponding Web sites, and their manner of operation. These categories can be used by Web site designers to reduce Web site privacy vulnerabilities and ensure that their stated and actual policies are consistent with each other. The same categories can be used by customers to evaluate and understand policies and their limitations. Additionally, the policies have potential use by third-party evaluators of site policies and conflicts.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-003-0183-z,,"['Privacy requirements', 'Security requirements']",90Citations,Springer,,Annie I.

Acquiring and incorporating state-dependent timing requirements,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA",19-Feb-04,"AbstractSome real-time systems are designed to deliver services to objects that are controlled by external sources. Their services must be delivered on a timely basis, and the system fails when some services are delivered too late. In general, the timing requirements of the system may change when the states of the objects monitored by the system change. Such a system may fail if the timing requirements which it is designed to meet are erroneous. It may underutilize resources and consequently be costly or unreliable if the requirements are too stringent. Hence, one must identify how changes in object states call for changes in system requirements and how these changes should be incorporated into the design and implementation of the system. This paper first describes a methodology to determine timing requirements and to take into account requirement changes at runtime. The method is based on several timing requirement determination schemes. Simulation data show that these schemes are effective for applications such as mobile IP hand-offs. The paper then discusses how to incorporate this methodology in the system architecture and in the development process.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-004-0190-8,,"['Real-time requirements', 'Requirement capture and update', 'Real-time software architecture']",2Citations,Springer,,C.

Deriving tabular event-based specifications from goal-oriented requirements models,,"Département d’Ingénierie Informatique, Université catholique de Louvain, B-1348, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium",03-Apr-04,"AbstractGoal-oriented methods are increasingly popular for elaborating software requirements. They offer systematic support for incrementally building intentional, structural and operational models of the software and its environment. They also provide various techniques for early analysis, notably, to manage conflicting goals or to anticipate abnormal environment behaviours that prevent goals from being achieved. On the other hand, tabular event-based methods are well-established for specifying operational requirements for control software. They provide sophisticated techniques and tools for late analysis of software behaviour models through simulation, model checking or table exhaustiveness checks. The paper proposes to take the best out of these two worlds to engineer requirements for control software. It presents a technique for deriving event-based specifications, written in the SCR tabular language, from operational specifications built according to the KAOS goal-oriented method. The technique consists of a series of transformation steps each of which resolves semantic, structural or syntactic differences between the KAOS source language and the SCR target language. Some of these steps need human intervention and illustrate the kind of semantic subtleties that need to be taken into account when integrating multiple formalisms. As a result of our technique SCR specifiers may use upstream goal-based processes à la KAOS for the incremental elaboration, early analysis, organization and documentation of their tables, while KAOS modelers may use downstream tables à la SCR for later analysis of the behaviour models derived from goal specifications.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-004-0189-1,,"['Goal-oriented requirements engineering', 'SCR', 'Method integration', 'Specification transformation', 'Lightweight formal analysis']",13Citations,Springer,,Renaud De Landtsheer,Emmanuel Letier,Axel van Lamsweerde,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-004-0189-1,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

These techniques have been implemented in a tool, called the T-Tool, that maps Formal Tropos specifications into a language that can be handled by the NuSMV model checker.

Eliciting gaps in requirements change,,"CRI, Université Paris 1, Sorbonne, 90 rue de Tolbiac, 75013 , Paris, France",18-Jun-03,AbstractWe consider requirements change due to system evolution which results from contextual forces such as the decision to standardise practices across subsidiaries of a company. Our experience with the financial branch of the French Renault group is that eliciting change requirements poses its own specific problems. We propose to model change as a set of gaps between the requirements specification of the current and the future system. Our approach is to define a generic typology of gaps to facilitate a precise definition of change requirements. It adopts a goal oriented requirements specification and shows how to customise the generic gap typology to this specific requirements representation formalism.

Market research for requirements analysis using linguistic tools,,"Department of Computer and Telecommunication Technology, University of Trento, Via Sommarive 14, 38050, Trento, Italy",30-Oct-03,"AbstractNumerous studies in recent months have proposed the use of linguistic instruments to support requirements analysis. There are two main reasons for this: (i) the progress made in natural language processing and (ii) the need to provide the developers of software systems with support in the early phases of requirements definition and conceptual modelling. This paper presents the results of an online market research intended (a) to assess the economic advantages of developing a CASE (computer-aided software engineering) tool that integrates linguistic analysis techniques for documents written in natural language, and (b) to verify the existence of the potential demand for such a tool. The research included a study of the language – ranging from completely natural to highly restricted – used in documents available for requirements analysis, an important factor given that on a technological level there is a trade-off between the language used and the performance of the linguistic instruments. To determine the potential demand for such tool, some of the survey questions dealt with the adoption of development methodologies and consequently with models and support tools; other questions referred to activities deemed critical by the companies involved. Through statistical correspondence analysis of the responses, we were able to outline two “profiles” of companies that correspond to two potential market niches, which are characterised by their very different approach to software development.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-003-0179-8,,"['Conceptual modelling', 'Market research', 'NLP-based CASE tools', 'Potential demand', 'Requirements analysis']",108Citations,Springer,,Mich Luisa,Franch Mariangela,Novi Inverardi Pierluigi,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-003-0179-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
An exploratory study into whether to or not to include users in the development of industrial hypermedia applications,,"SIMMO, Ecole Nationale Supérieur des Mines de St-Etienne, 158, Cours Fauriel, 42023, St-Etienne Cedex 2, France",30-Sep-03,"AbstractWhile there is agreement among both information system (IS) practitioners and IS researchers as to the value of user participation in IS development, the correlation between user participation and actual use or user satisfaction (surrogate measures of IS success) has been equivocal. A possible reason for the contradictory findings could be that user participation is being utilised, regardless of the levels of complexity of either the system or the task. This paper describes two exploratory case studies to test this hypothesis. Industrial hypermedia applications (IHA) were developed and qualitative data collected, through usability trials, to see the effect of user participation on user perception (extrinsic motivations of use) of the system, rather than IS success. The findings show that users should participate in the development when both the IS and the task are complex. On the other hand, when both the system and the task are not complex, user participation can be kept to a minimum. Furthermore, it is recommended that user participation should not be evaluated against IS success, but against system features.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-003-0180-2,,"['Hypermedia applications', '\nSystem complexity\n', '\nTask complexity\n', 'Technology acceptance model', '\nUser-IS relationship\n', 'User participation']",6Citations,Springer,,Devendra Fakun,Richard M.

An economic approach for improving requirements negotiation models with inspection,,"Systems Engineering and Automation, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, 4040 , Linz, Austria",13-May-03,"AbstractStakeholder goals identified during requirements elicitation are usually informal and incomplete statements about a system considered for development. There are numerous approaches for capturing such informal models. For example, we have found the EasyWinWin requirements negotiation method to be an efficient way for attaining consensus among the success-critical stakeholders. The WinWin negotiation model captures stakeholder goals as win conditions, issues, options and agreements. When such a model has to be transformed into more formal representations, quality becomes particularly important. Approaches for validating such informal models can increase quality and provide guidance for further refinement of requirements. Inspection is a proven approach to identify defects and is also applicable to early life cycle artifacts. This paper reports on an empirical study demonstrating the usefulness of an inspection technique for requirements negotiation models. The study employs a conservative economic model, which considers the effect of defect slippage during development on defect detection benefits from inspection. The main finding of the study is that inspection is an economic validation technique for requirements negotiation models. There are, however, certain limitations that need to be studied in more detail.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-002-0155-8,,"['Inspection techniques', 'Requirements negotiation', 'Stakeholder-based reasoning', 'Validation of best-practice models']",16Citations,Springer,,Michael Halling,Stefan Biffl,Paul Grünbacher,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-002-0155-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Merging individual conceptual models of requirements ,,"Department of Computing, Division of Information and Communication Sciences, Macquarie University, 2109, Sydney, NSW, Australia",15-Mar-03,"AbstractWhile it is acknowledged that system requirements will never be complete, incompleteness is often due to an inadequate process and methods for acquiring and tracking a representative set of requirements. Viewpoint development has been proposed to address these problems. We offer a viewpoint development approach that fits easily into the current practice of capturing requirements as use case descriptions. However, current practice does not support visualization of use case descriptions, the capture of multiple use case descriptions, the modeling of conflicts and the reconciliation of viewpoints. In our approach we apply techniques from natural language processing, term subsumption and set-theory to automatically convert the use case descriptions into a line diagram. The visualisation of use case descriptions is a natural addition to the object-oriented design of systems using the Unified Modelling Language where diagrams act as communication and validation devices. RECOCASE is a comprehensive methodology that includes use case description guidelines, a controlled language to support natural language translation, a requirements engineering process model and a tool to assist the specification and reconciliation of requirements. Our approach combines group and individual processes to minimise contradictions and missing information and maximise ownership of the requirements models.

Arcade: early dynamic property evaluation of requirements using partitioned software architecture models,,"Laboratory for Intelligent Processes and Systems, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, 78712-1084, USA",03-Jun-03,"Abstract A fundamental goal of software engineering research is to develop evaluation techniques that enable analysis early in the software development process, when correcting errors is less costly. The Systems Engineering Process Activities (SEPA) Arcade tool employs a number of techniques to evaluate dynamic properties of requirements including correctness, performance, and reliability. To mitigate a number of practical issues associated with dynamic property evaluation, Arcade leverages the SEPA 3D Architecture, a formal requirements representation that partitions requirements types amongst a set of interrelated architecture models. This paper presents a case study illustrating how Arcade uses the SEPA 3D Architecture to help manage complexity associated with dynamic property evaluation, to reduce the level of evaluation technique expertise required to perform dynamic property evaluations, and to support an iterative, incremental approach that allows early evaluation using partial requirements models.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-002-0159-4,,"['Dynamic properties', 'Requirements models', 'Software architecture']",3Citations,Springer,,K.

It is based on a simple quantitative model of risk and is supported by custom software. We have used it to aid in study and planning for systems that employ advanced technologies. The framework has proven successful at identifying problematic requirements (those which will be the most difficult to attain), at optimizing the allocation of resources so as to maximize requirements attainment, at identifying areas where research investments should be made, and at supporting tradeoff analyses among major alternatives. We describe the DDP model, the information that populates a model, how DDP is used, and its tool support. DDP has been designed to aid decision making early in development. Detailed information is lacking at this early stage. Accordingly, DDP exhibits a number of strategic compromises between fidelity and tractability.

Retrenching partial requirements into system definitions: a simple feature interaction case study,,"Computer Science Department, Manchester University, Manchester,  M13 9PL, UK",05-Sep-03,"AbstractIn conventional model-oriented formal refinement, the abstract model is supposed to capture all the properties of interest in the system, in an as-clutter-free-as-possible manner. Subsequently, the refinement process guides development inexorably towards a faithful implementation. However, refinement says nothing about how to obtain the abstract model in the first place. In reality developers experiment with prototype models and their refinements until a workable arrangement is discovered.Retrenchment is a formal technique intended to capture some of the informal approach to a refinable abstract model in a formal manner that will integrate with refinement. This is in order that the benefits of a formal approach can migrate further up the development hierarchy. The basic ideas of retrenchment are presented, and a simple telephone system feature interaction case study is elaborated. This illustrates not only how retrenchment can relate incompatible and partial models to a more definitive consolidated model during the development of the contracted specification, but also that the same formalism is applicable in a re-engineering context, where the subsequent evolution of a system may be partly incompatible with earlier design decisions. The case study illustrates how the natural method of composing retrenchments can give results that are too liberal in certain cases, and stronger laws of composition are derived for systems possessing suitable properties. It is shown that the methodology can encompass more ad hoc and custom-built techniques such as Zave's layered feature engineering approach to applications exhibiting a feature-oriented architecture (such as telephony).",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-002-0157-6,,"['Requirement engineering', 'Partial requirements', 'Formal development', 'Retrenchment', 'Refinement', 'Telephony', 'Feature engineering', 'Feature interaction']",17Citations,Springer,,R.

Automating performance-related impact analysis through event based traceability,,"Department of Computer Science, DePaul University, 243 So. Wabash Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60604-2287, USA",17-Jul-03,"AbstractCurrent impact analysis techniques tend to focus on assessing the impact of change upon the system's functionality, whilst a consideration of performance related requirements is often deferred until after implementation. This tendency can lead to costly and time-consuming mistakes that frustrate customers and require frantic last-minute efforts to fix. This paper proposes a method for supporting performance-related impact analysis in a heterogeneous software engineering environment. An event-based approach is taken to establish dynamic traceability links, capable of propagating data values and commands between requirements and performance models. Quantitative values in performance related requirements are adjusted to reflect proposed changes, and impacted models are re-executed to measure the impact of the change. The resulting outputs are then automatically compared to relevant performance requirements and a system-wide report showing the impact of the proposed change upon performance is generated.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-003-0175-z,,"['Change management', 'Event-based traceability', 'Impact analysis', 'NFR', 'Performance', 'Traceability']",16Citations,Springer,,Jane Cleland-Huang,Carl K.

RE challenges in multi-site software development organisations,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, P. O. Box 3055, BC, V8W 3P6, Canada",22-Jul-03,"AbstractThe increasing globalisation of the software industry demands an investigation of requirements engineering (RE) in multi-site software development organisations. Requirements engineering is a task difficult enough when done locally—but it is even more difficult when cross-functional stakeholder groups specify requirements across cultural, language and time zone boundaries. This paper reports on a field study that investigated RE challenges introduced by the stakeholders' geographical distribution in a multi-site organisation. The goal was to examine RE practices in global software development, and to formulate recommendations for improvement as well as to provide directions for future research on methods and tools. Based on the empirical evidence, we have constructed a model of how remote communication and knowledge management, cultural diversity and time differences negatively impact requirements gathering, negotiations and specifications. Findings reveal that aspects such as a lack of a common understanding of requirements, together with a reduced awareness of a working local context, a trust level and an ability to share work artefacts significantly challenge the effective collaboration of remote stakeholders in negotiating a set of requirements that satisfies geographically distributed customers. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving RE practices in this setting.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-003-0173-1,,"['Communication problems', 'Global software development', 'Requirements engineering', 'Requirements management', 'Requirements process']",190Citations,Springer,,Daniela E.

Applications of linguistic techniques for use case analysis,,"Dip. di Sistemi e Informatica, Università di Firenze, Italy",16-Jul-03,"AbstractUse cases are effective techniques to express the functional requirements of a system in a very simple and easy-to-learn way. Use cases are mainly composed of natural language (NL) sentences, and the use of NL to describe the behaviour of a system is always a critical point, due to the inherent ambiguities originating from the different possible interpretations of NL sentences. We discuss in this paper the application of analysis techniques based on a linguistic approach to detect, within requirements documents, defects related to such an inherent ambiguity. Starting from the proposed analysis techniques, we will define some metrics that will be used to perform a quality evaluation of requirements documents. Some available automatic tools supporting the linguistic analysis of NL requirements have been used to evaluate an industrial use cases document according to the defined metrics. A discussion on the application of linguistic analysis techniques to support the semantic analysis of use cases is also reported.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-003-0174-0,,"['Natural language processing', 'Quality evaluation of requirements', 'Requirements engineering', 'Use cases']",74Citations,Springer,,A.

An exploratory study of facilitation in distributed requirements engineering,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria, PO Box 3055, BC V8W 3P6, Canada",12-Apr-03,"AbstractThere is an increasing need to build an understanding of group facilitation in distributed requirements engineering. Group facilitation is an important element of group approaches to requirements engineering, which is being challenged by the emergence of distributed practices in software specification and development. Thus thorough empirical investigation of human facilitation in computer-mediated requirements meetings is needed. This paper presents an exploratory study of facilitation in distributed requirements teams. Three professional facilitators mediate 15 three-person groups in an experimental simulation of software requirements negotiation. Facilitation in face-to-face meetings is contrasted with four group settings in which the facilitator is physically separated from the group or co-located with key stakeholders. Rich qualitative and behavioural data enables an understanding of differences and similarities in the facilitation of face-to-face and distributed groups and of aspects that were detrimental or beneficial to their facilitation. The empirical evidence indicates that a reduced richness of social behaviours in computer-mediated group settings (1) made the group facilitation problematic but also (2) enabled certain facilitation support in the medium itself. The findings of the study are discussed in the light of existing models of the role of the facilitator. Advice from the expert facilitators is presented in the form of recommendations for the facilitation of distributed requirements teams, and worthwhile directions for further research are outlined.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-002-0164-7,,"['Conflict resolution', 'Computer-supported cooperative work', 'Distributed facilitation', 'Distributed synchronous meetings', 'Empirical work', 'Groupware', 'Requirements negotiation']",25Citations,Springer,,Daniela E.

Nevertheless, there are times when it seems like a product family approach should work when, in fact, there are difficulties in properly defining the boundaries of the product family. In this paper, we draw on our experiences in applying the software product-line approach to a family of mobile robots, a family of flight guidance systems, and a family of cardiac pacemakers, as well as case studies done by others to (1) illustrate how domain structure can currently limit applicability of product-line approaches to certain domains and (2) demonstrate our progress towards a solution using a set-theoretic approach to reason about domains of what we call n-dimensional and hierarchical product families.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-003-0166-0,,"['Domain Engineering', 'Product line engineering', 'Product line modelling', 'Requirements reuse', 'Requirements structuring']",23Citations,Springer,,Jeffrey M.

Continuous requirements management for organisation networks: a (dis)trust-based approach,,"Informatik V, RWTH Aachen, Ahornstr. 55, 52056 , Aachen, Germany",24-Apr-03,"AbstractRecently, viewpoint resolution methods which make conflicts productive for requirements engineering have gained popularity in organisational information systems. However, when extending such methods beyond organisational boundaries to inter-organisational social networks, sociological research indicates that a delicate balance of trust in individuals, confidence in the network as a whole, and watchful distrust becomes a key success factor. We capture these relationships in the so-called TCD (Trust–Confidence–Distrust) approach and demonstrate how this approach can be supported by a dynamic requirements engineering environment that combines the structural analysis of strategic dependencies and rationales, with the interaction between planning, tracing, and communicative action. An example drawn from an ongoing case study in entrepreneurship networks illustrates our approach, complemented by a brief sketch of a prototypical implementation of a simulation environment based on our methodology.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-002-0163-8,,"['Conceptual modelling', 'ConGolog', 'Inter-organisational systems', 'Metadata management', 'Requirements engineering', 'Telos', 'Trust', 'Viewpoint resolution']",25Citations,Springer,,Günter Gans,Matthias Jarke,Stefanie Kethers,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-002-0163-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

"Authorisation Requirements on a Budget
",,"Alternative Output Inc., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, , , , , , CA",Dec-02,"Engineering information system deployment is squeezed by a shrinking commitment to requirements definition and an expanding need to determine the security requirements of such systems. This paper examines the causes and effects of this squeeze. Commitment is shrinking because of past requirements experiences, misunderstood trends in system development and requirements fatigue, while needs are expanding because of recent emphasis on Internet access to data, online transactions and workflow, which greatly increase the severity of the authorisation problem. Some approaches to quantifying and addressing this problem are introduced.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660200014,,['Key words:Authorization – Dependency analysis – Security requirements'],,Springer,,Darrell Raymond,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007660200014,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
"A Software Fault Tree Approach to Requirements Analysis of an Intrusion Detection System
",,"Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA, , , , , , US",Dec-02,"Requirements analysis for an intrusion detection system (IDS) involves deriving requirements for the IDS from analysis of the intrusion domain. When the IDS is, as here, a collection of mobile agents that detect, classify, and correlate system and network activities, the derived requirements include what activities the agent software should monitor, what intrusion characteristics the agents should correlate, where the IDS agents should be placed to feasibly detect the intrusions, and what countermeasures the software should initiate. This paper describes the use of software fault trees for requirements identification and analysis in an IDS. Intrusions are divided into seven stages (following Ruiu), and a fault subtree is developed to model each of the seven stages (reconnaissance, penetration, etc.). Two examples are provided. This approach was found to support requirements evolution (as new intrusions were identified), incremental development of the IDS, and prioritisation of countermeasures.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660200016,,['Key words:Coloured Petri nets – Intrusion detection system – Mobile agents – Requirements analysis – Software fault tree'],65Citations,Springer,,Guy Helmer,Johnny Wong,Mark Slagell,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007660200016,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
"Automatically Detecting and Visualising Errors in UML Diagrams
",,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA, , , , , , US",Dec-02,"UML has become the de facto standard for object-oriented modelling. Currently, UML comprises several different notations with no formal semantics attached to the individual diagrams or their integration, thus preventing rigorous analysis of the diagrams. Previously, we developed a formalisation framework that attaches formal semantics to a subset of UML diagrams used to model embedded systems. This paper describes automated structural and behavioural analyses applicable to UML diagrams using our formalisation framework. In addition to intra- and inter-diagram consistency checks, we discuss how simulation and model checking can be used in tandem for behavioural analysis of the UML diagrams. Our tools also visually interpret the analysis results in terms of the original UML diagrams, thereby facilitating their correction and refinement. We illustrate these capabilities through the modelling and analysis of UML diagrams for an automotive industrial case study.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660200020,,['Key words:Formal specifications – Model checking – Simulation – UML'],31Citations,Springer,,Laura A.

"Toward Automation for Model-Checking Requirements Specifications with Numeric Constraints
",,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, , , , , , US",Dec-02,"Model-checking techniques have not been effective in important classes of software systems – systems characterised by large (or infinite) input domains with interrelated linear and non-linear constraints over the system variables. Various model abstraction techniques have been proposed to address this problem, but their effectiveness in practice is limited by two factors: first, the abstraction process is manual and requires a great deal of ingenuity; and, second, the abstraction may be coarse and introduce too many spurious behaviours to provide meaningful analysis results. In this paper, we wish to propose domain reduction abstraction based on data equivalence and trajectory reduction as an alternative and complement to other abstraction tech niques. Our technique applies the abstraction to the input domain (environment) instead of the model and is applicable to constraint free and deterministic constrained data transition systems. Our technique is automatable with some minor restrictions. We provide formal proofs for the theoretical soundness of the technique, algorithms for automation, and an illustration of the approach with examples.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660200018,,['Key words:Abstraction – Model checking specifications – Numeric constraints'],7Citations,Springer,,Yunja Choi,Sanjai Rayadurgam,Mats P.E.

This paper examines the development of a requirements document for a multilevel secure system that must meet stringent assurance and evaluation requirements. The system is designed to be secure, yet combines popular commercial components with specialised high-assurance ones. Functional and non-functional requirements pertinent to security are discussed. A multidimensional threat model is presented. The threat model accounts for the developmental and operational phases of system evolution and for each phase accounts for both physical and non-physical threats. We describe our team-based method for developing a requirements document and relate that process to techniques in requirements engineering.

Release Planning in Market-Driven Software Product Development: Provoking an Understanding,,"Department of Computer and Information Science, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden, , , , , , SE",Sep-02,"In market-driven software development, release planning is one of the most critical tasks. Selecting a subset of requirements for realisation in a certain release is as complex as it is important for the success of a software product. Despite this, the literature provides little information on how release planning is done in practice. We designed, implemented and evaluated a support tool for release planning as a means for provoking a rich understanding of the task of release planning. The tool utilises a selection algorithm which, based on value, resource estimate and interdependencies, presents a number of valid and good release suggestions. The initial attempt at supporting release planning proved to be based on an overly simplistic and structuralistic view. The results provide ample evidence that the task could be characterised as a wicked problem, which in turn has several implications for the support needed. Although the provotype could indeed support the planner, in its current version it has several serious shortcomings related to the degree of interactivity, underlying models, presentation of information and general appearance. A rich description of the task of release planning is provided. Based on these findings, a list of design implications is proposed, which is intended to guide the future design of a support tool for release planning.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660200010,,['Key words:Pragmatic algorithm – Provotype – Release planning – Requirements coupling – Requirements interdependencies – Wicked problem'],123Citations,Springer,,Pär Carlshamre,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007660200010,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Large-Scale Requirements Analysis Revisited: The need for Understanding the Political Ecology of Requirements Engineering,,"Department of Information and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, California, USA, , , , , , US",Sep-02,"This paper addresses the political nature of requirements for large systems, and argues that requirements engineering theory and practice must become more engaged with these issues. It argues that large-scale system requirements is constructed through a political decision process, whereby requirements emerge as a set of mappings between consecutive solution spaces justified by a problem space of concern to a set of principals. These solution spaces are complex socio-technical ensembles that often exhibit non-linear behaviour in expansion due to domain complexity and political ambiguity. Stabilisation of solutions into agreed-on specifications occurs only through the exercise of organisational power. Effective requirements engineering in such cases is most effectively seen as a form of heterogeneous engineering in which technical, social, economic and institutional factors are brought together in a current solution space that provides the baseline for construction of proposed new solution spaces.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660200011,,['Key words:Functional requirements – Heterogeneous engineering – Political requirements – System failures – System requirements'],67Citations,Springer,,Mark Bergman,John Leslie King,Kalle Lyytinen,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007660200011,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

WIRES: A Methodology for Developing Workflow Applications,,"Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, California, USA, US",19-Feb-14,"Workflow management systems are becoming a relevant support for a large class of business applications, and many workflow models as well as commercial products are currently available. While the large availability of tools facilitates the development and the fulfilment of customer requirements, workflow application development still requires methodological guidelines that drive the developers in the complex task of rapidly producing effective applications. In fact, it is necessary to identify and model the business processes, to design the interfaces towards existing cooperating systems, and to manage implementation aspects in an integrated way. This paper presents the WIRES methodology for developing workflow applications under a uniform modelling paradigm – UML modelling tools with some extensions – that covers all the life cycle of these applications: from conceptual analysis to implementation. High-level analysis is performed under different perspectives, including a business and an organisational perspective. Distribution, interoperability and cooperation with external information systems are considered in this early stage. A set of “workflowability” criteria is provided in order to identify which candidate processes are suited to be implemented as workflows. Non-functional requirements receive particular emphasis in that they are among the most important criteria for deciding whether workflow technology can be actually useful for implementing the business process at hand. The design phase tackles aspects of concurrency and cooperation, distributed transactions and exception handling. Reuse of component workflows, available in a repository as workflow fragments, is a distinguishing feature of the method. Implementation aspects are presented in terms of rules that guide in the selection of a commercial workflow management system suitable for supporting the designed processes, coupled with guidelines for mapping the designed workflows onto the model offered by the selected system.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660200006,,['Key words:Extensions to UML – Methodology – Reusable patterns – Workflow – Workflows for e-services'],12Citations,Springer,,Fabio Casati,Maria Grazia Fugini,Isabelle Mirbel,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007660200006,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Socially oriented methodologies provide more support for user involvement in design than the rigidity of more traditional methods, facilitating the degree of user–designer communication and the ‘capture’ of requirements. A more emergent and collaborative view of requirements elicitation and communication is required to encompass the user, contextual and organisational factors. From this accompanying literature in communication issues in requirements elicitation, a four-dimensional framework is outlined and used to appraise comparatively four different methodologies seeking to promote a closer working relationship between users and designers. The facilitation of communication between users and designers is subject to discussion of the ways in which communicative activities can be ‘optimised’ for successful requirements gathering, by making recommendations based on the four dimensions to provide fruitful considerations for system designers.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660200004,,"['Communication –', 'Context –', 'Elicitation –', 'Requirements –', 'Socially oriented methodologies –', 'User–designer interaction']",111Citations,Springer,,Jane Coughlan,Robert D.

In this paper, a requirements engineering-based conceptual modelling approach is introduced as a way to improve the quality of the software production process. The aim of this approach is to provide a set of techniques and methods to capture software requirements and to provide a way to move from requirements to a conceptual schema in a traceable way. The approach combines a framework for requirements engineering (TRADE) and a graphical object-oriented method for conceptual modelling and code generation (OO-Method). The intended improvement of the software production process is accomplished by providing a precise methodological guidance to go from the user requirements (represented through the use of the appropriate TRADE techniques) to the conceptual schema that properly represents them (according to the conceptual constructs provided by the OO-Method). Additionally, as the OO-Method provides full model-based code generation features, this combination minimises the time dedicated to obtaining the final software product.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660200005,,['Key words:Conceptual modelling – OO methods – Requirements engineering – Traceability – Use cases'],83Citations,Springer,,E.

Round-Trip Prototyping Based on Integrated Functional and User Interface Requirements Specifications,,"University of Hagen, Germany, , , , , , DE",Apr-02,"Requirements engineering in the new millennium is facing an increasing diversity of computerised devices comprising an increasing diversity of interaction styles for an increasing diversity of user groups. Thus the incorporation of user interface requirements into software requirements specifications becomes more and more mandatory. Validating these requirements specifications with hand-made, throw-away prototypes is not only expensive, but also bears the danger that validation results are not accurately fed back into the requirements specification. In this paper, we propose an enhancement of the requirements specification method SCORES for an explicit capturing of user interface requirements. The advantages of the approach are threefold. First, the user interface requirements specification is UML-compliant and integrated into the functional requirements specification. Second, prototypes for validation purposes can semi-automatically be generated. Third, the model-based generation of prototypes allows for ‘round-trip prototyping’ such that manual changes of the prototype during the validation process are automatically fed back into the requirements specification.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660200003,,['Key words:Prototyping – Requirements engineering – Round-Trip Prototyping – UML – User Interface Requirements – Validation'],11Citations,Springer,,Andreas Homrighausen,Hans-Werner Six,Mario Winter,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007660200003,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Requirements Reuse for Improving Information Systems Security: A Practitioner’s Approach,,"Departamento de Informática y Sistemas, Universidad de Murcia, Murcia, Spain, , , , , , ES",Jan-02,"Information systems security issues have usually been considered only after the system has been developed completely, and rarely during its design, coding, testing or deployment. However, the advisability of considering security from the very beginning of the system development has recently begun to be appreciated, and in particular in the system requirements specification phase. We present a practical method to elicit and specify the system and software requirements, including a repository containing reusable requirements, a spiral process model, and a set of requirements documents templates. In this paper, this method is focused on the security of information systems and, thus, the reusable requirements repository contains all the requirements taken from MAGERIT, the Spanish public administration risk analysis and management method, which conforms to ISO 15408, Common Criteria Framework. Any information system including these security requirements must therefore pass a risk analysis and management study performed with MAGERIT. The requirements specification templates are hierarchically structured and are based on IEEE standards.

Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering: A Unifying Framework,,"Department of Cultural Technology and Communication, University of the Aegean, Mytilene, Greece, , , , , , GR",Jan-02,"The study of contemporary requirements engineering (RE) methodologies indicates that modelling of organisational goals constitutes a central activity of the RE process. In particular, goals provide the rationale and drive the elaboration of the requirements that operationalise them. They also provide the criteria against which the completeness and correctness of the requirements specification is validated. In other words, requirements implement goals in the same way that programs implement design specifications. Despite the significance of goals in RE, research in the field is fragmented. No research has so far taken place in order to define the overall role that goals play in RE. This paper puts forward a unifying view of goal analysis in the context of RE. This allows the identification of similarities and differences between the different conceptions of goal used by different approaches and promotes the understanding of the overall role of goal analysis in RE. Based on this understanding the various approaches can be put together, thus leading to a stronger goal-driven RE framework that takes advantage of the contributions from the many streams of goal-oriented research.",https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00010362,,['Key words:Goal analysis – Goal modelling – Goal-oriented requirements engineering – Method integration'],59Citations,Springer,,Evangelia Kavakli,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00010362,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Engineering Methods from Method Requirements Specifications,,"Delhi College of Engineering, Delhi, India, , , , , , IN",Oct-01,"By analogy with a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), it is argued that a Method Requirements Specification (MRS) should be introduced in method engineering. It shares with the SRS the property of implementation-independence. This means that an MRS must be an instance of an abstract metamodel and not of a technical metamodel like GOPRR (Graph, Object, Property, Relationship, and Role). The MRS is then translated to be an instantiation of a technical metamodel.

Using Influence Diagrams to Aid the Management of Software Change,,"Department of Computer Science, , , , , , GB",Oct-01,"In a large software management programme, the number of software changes and enhancements requested for inclusion in the next software release often far exceeds the implementation resources available. Thus, during the preceding months before the final decision is made on which changes to include, there needs to be a way of incorporating all the different factors that influence these possible changes into a coherent set of information to enable good decisions to be made. This paper describes the use of influence diagrams to implement a risk model to formalise the combining of these different factors to aid the decision process. This model not only reflects the likelihood of all the necessary criteria for a requested change to be viable being met, but also considers the financial or other benefits to the organisation that would result from the change being included in the next software release.",https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00010358,,['Key words:Influence diagrams – Risk-based modelling – Software change'],5Citations,Springer,,Colin J.

Modelling Off-the-Shelf Information Systems Requirements: An Ontological Approach,,"Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, , , , , , IL",Oct-01,"Requirements for choosing off-the-shelf information systems (OISR) differ from requirements for development of new information systems in that they do not necessarily provide complete specifications, thus allowing flexibility in matching an existing IS to the stated needs. We present a framework for OISR conceptual models that consists of four essential elements: business processes, business rules, information objects and required system services. We formalise the definitions of these concepts based on an ontological model. The ontology-based OISR model provides a framework to evaluate modelling languages on how appropriate they are for OISR requirements specifications. The evaluation framework is applied to the Object-Process Methodology, and its results are compared with a similar evaluation of ARIS. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the ontological framework for evaluating modelling tools on how well they can guide selection, implementation and integration of purchased software packages.",https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00010359,,['Key words:Conceptual model – Object-Process Methodology – Off-the-shelf information systems – Ontology – Requirements specification'],42Citations,Springer,,Pnina Soffer,Boaz Golany,Dov Dori,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00010359,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

A Framework for Component Reuse in a Metamodelling-Based Software Development,,"Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland, , , , , , FI",Jun-01,"Reuse forms one key mechanism in improving system development productivity and quality. In this paper we suggest a systematic framework for reuse processes, which is driven by ideas and concepts based on metamodelling. The framework enables us to consider reuse in a comprehensive manner and to develop support for reuse processes within a metaCASE environment. By utilising metamodelling concepts we expand reuse situations to cover both design artefacts and method components. Accordingly, the reuse framework consists of a system development process model, a type level hierarchy, a classification of reuse situation types, a component granularity model, and a model of reuse operations. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework by analysing reuse support in a metaCASE environment: MetaEdit+. We also examine how the framework can help to strategise over possible software development scenarios (patterns) that involve various levels of reuse in situations where software requirements change considerably and there is a considerable number of design assets to exploit.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660170009,,['Key words:Component – Information type levels – MetaCASE environment – Metamodelling – Reuse framework'],7Citations,Springer,,Zheying Zhang,Kalle Lyytinen,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007660170009,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

In particular, recent research has pointed out that conceptual models need to model goals, in order to capture the intentions which underlie complex situations within an organisational context. This paper focuses on one class of goals, namely non-functional requirements (NFR), which need to be captured and analysed from the very early phases of the software development process. The paper presents a framework for integrating NFRs into the ER and OO models. This framework has been validated by two case studies, one of which is very large.

Making Workflow Change Acceptable,,"Infolab, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands, , , , , , NL",Jun-01,"Virtual professional communities are supported by network information systems composed from standard Internet tools. To satisfy the interests of all community members, a user-driven approach to requirements engineering is proposed that produces not only meaningful but also acceptable specifications. This approach is especially suited for workflow systems that support partially structured, evolving work processes. To ensure the acceptability, social norms must guide the specification process. The RENISYS specification method is introduced, which facilitates this process using composition norms as formal representations of social norms. Conceptual graph theory is used to represent four categories of knowledge definitions: type definitions, state definitions, action norms and composition norms. It is shown how the composition norms guide the legitimate user-driven specification process by analysing a case on the development of an electronic law journal.",https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00010357,,['Key words:Breakdown – Knowledge representation – Legitimate user-driven specification – Social norms – Virtual communities – Workflow modelling'],5Citations,Springer,,Aldo de Moor,Manfred A.

From Non-Functional Requirements to Design through Patterns,,"Faculty of Information Studies, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, , , , , , CA",Feb-01,"Design patterns aid in documenting and communicating proven design solutions to recurring problems. They describe not only how to solve design problems, but also why a solution is chosen over others and what trade-offs are made. Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are pervasive in descriptions of design patterns. They play a crucial role in understanding the problem being addressed, the trade-offs discussed, and the design solution proposed. However, since design patterns are mostly expressed as informal text, the structure of the design reasoning is not systematically organised. This paper proposes a systematic treatment of NFRs in descriptions of patterns and when applying patterns during design. The approach organises, analyses and refines non-functional requirements, and provides guidance and reasoning support when applying patterns during the design of a software system. Three design patterns taken from the literature are used to illustrate this approach.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660170013,,['Key words:Architectural properties – Design patterns – Non-functional requirements – Process-oriented – Quality attributes – Quality requirements – Rationale – Requirements – Satisfying – Softgoal'],129Citations,Springer,,Daniel Gross,Eric Yu,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007660170013,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Coupling Use Cases and Class Models as a Means for Validation and Verification of Requirements Specifications,,"ISOWARE GmbH, Hagen, Germany, , , , , , DE",Feb-01,"In many applications, especially from the business domain, the requirements specification mainly deals with use cases and class models. Unfortunately, these models are based on different modelling techniques and aim at different levels of abstraction, such that serious consistency and completeness problems are induced. To overcome these deficiencies, we refine activity graphs to meet the needs for a suitable modelling element for use case behaviour. The refinement in particular supports the proper coupling of use cases via activity graphs and the class model. The granularity and semantics of our approach allow for a seamless, traceable transition of use cases to the class model and for the verification of the class model against the use case model. The validation of the use case model and parts of the class model is supported as well. Experience from several applications has shown that the investment in specification, validation and verification not only pays off during system and acceptance testing but also significantly improves the quality of the final product.",https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00010354,,['Key words:Activity graphs – Class models – Requirements engineering – UML – Use cases – Validation – Verification'],28Citations,Springer,,Georg Kösters,Hans-Werner Six,Mario Winter,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00010354,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
An Industrial Case Study on Distributed Prioritisation in Market-Driven Requirements Engineering for Packaged Software,,"Department of Communication Systems, Lund University, Sweden, , , , , , SE",Feb-01,"When developing packaged software, which is sold ‘off-the-shelf’ on a worldwide marketplace, it is essential to collect needs and opportunities from different market segments and use this information in the prioritisation of requirements for the next software release. This paper presents an industrial case study where a distributed prioritisation process is proposed, observed and evaluated. The stakeholders in the requirements prioritisation process include marketing offices distributed around the world. A major objective of the distributed prioritisation is to gather and highlight the differences and similarities in the requirement priorities of the different market segments. The evaluation through questionnaires shows that the stakeholders found the process useful. The paper also presents novel approaches to visualise the priority distribution among stakeholders, together with measures on disagreement and satisfaction. Product management found the proposed charts valuable as decision support when selecting requirements for the next release, as they revealed unforeseen differences among stakeholder priorities.

Deriving Goals from a Use-Case Based Requirements Specification,,"College of Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, , , , , , US",Feb-01,"Use cases and scenarios have emerged as prominent analysis tools during requirements engineering activities due to both their richness and informality. In some instances, for example when a project’s budget or schedule time is reduced at short notice, practitioners have been known to adopt a collection of use cases as a suitable substitute for a requirements specification. Given the challenges inherent in managing large collections of scenarios, this shortcut is cause for concern and deserves focused attention. We describe our experiences during a goal-driven requirements analysis effort for an electronic commerce application. In particular, we identify the specific risks incurred, focusing more on the challenges imposed due to traceability, inconsistent use of terminology, incompleteness and consistency, rather than on traditional software project management risks.

This paper reports on an experiment to reduce the number of requirement defects. We analysed the present defects in a real-life product and estimated the likely effect of 44 prevention techniques. We had hoped a novel combination of techniques would come up, but the best approach was quite well known, although new to the company: study the user tasks better, make early prototypes of the user interface, and test them for usability. This approach was tried out in a new development project in the same company. Due to the new approach, there was no doubt about requirements during programming, and as a result it became the first project in the company that was completed on time and without stress.

A Method for Extracting and Stating Software Requirements that a User Interface Prototype Contains,,"Computer Science, Technion, Haifa, Israel, , , , , , IL",Dec-00,"User interface and requirements prototyping is a requirements elicitation technique. A user interface and requirements prototype is built during the requirements engineering phase of a software system development. Along with the user interface prototype are produced various documents such as the system requirement specification. When a prototype and other documents exist, they may not describe the same functionality, particularly because there may be behaviour of the prototype, artefacts of prototyping, that may not be intended. The problem is that in later development stages, when there is a prototype and other documents, it is often difficult to reconcile the difference between the prototype and the other documents. This paper presents an approach for avoiding this difficulty. It demonstrates the approach by showing its application to parts of a real software development.",https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00010352,,['Key words:Case study – Requirements elicitation – Requirements extraction – Requirements prototyping – Requirements tracing – User interface prototyping'],10Citations,Springer,,A.

Specifying and Analysing System-Level Inter-Component Interfaces,,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, , , , , , US",Dec-00,"In control systems, the interfaces between software and its embedding environment are a major source of costly errors. For example, Lutz reported that 20–35% of the safety-related errors discovered during integration and system testing of two spacecraft were related to the interfaces between the software and the embedding hardware. Also, the software’s operating environment is likely to change over time, further complicating the issues related to system-level inter-component communication. In this paper we discuss a formal approach to the specification and analysis of inter-component communication using a revised version of RSML (Requirements State Machine Language). The formalism allows rigorous specification of the physical aspects of the inter-component communication and forces encapsulation of communication-related properties in well-defined and easy-to-read interface specifications. This enables us both to analyse a system design to detect incompatibilities between connected components and to use the interface specifications as safety kernels to enforce safety constraints.",https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00010351,,['Key words:Inter-component communication – Formal methods – Requirements specification – RSML – Safety kernel – State-based specification – Static analysis'],,Springer,,Mats P.

An Experimental Investigation into the Effectiveness of OOA for Specifying Requirements,,"Department of Accounting and Information Systems, Sellinger School of Business, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, , , , , , US",Dec-00,"The application of object oriented concepts (OO) to the requirements phase of information systems (IS) and software development has been adopted by many proponents of IS and software development methodologies. Although many claims have been made about the effectiveness of OO techniques for improving requirements analysis, very few experimental studies have been done to substantiate these claims. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by conducting an experimental study that attempts to validate the effectiveness of object-oriented analysis (OOA) by comparing it to structured analysis (SA) for producing requirements. We argue that the quality of the requirements specification can be measured and that measurement can be used to compare the effectiveness of OOA and SA. We present an overview of the basic models and principles associated with OOA and SA, a discussion of quality in requirements definition, and a detailed discussion of the research methodology used. A review of relevant research is also presented and directions for further research are suggested.

Bridging the Gap Between Organisational Needs and ERP Functionality,,"Universite´ Paris-1 Panthe´on Sorbonne, Paris, France, , , , , , FR",Oct-00,"We argue that Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) installations are difficult to align to specific requirements of the enterprise because of the low level at which ERP functionality is described. We raise this level from a functional description to a goal-oriented one. We use SAP R/3 to illustrate this. A SAP goal expresses the task that a SAP function carries out and abstracts away from the performance of this task. Since a SAP goal can be achieved in many ways, we introduce the notion of SAP strategies. We organise goals and strategies as a directed graph called a map. We illustrate the map with the Materials Management Module of SAP. In order to evaluate and compare the use of the map with the functional approach, we develop an evaluation framework.

Most conceptual and database models represent enterprises with no imprecise data. Very few approaches in the literature are dealing with imprecise data. In temporal data models and databases, approaches are dealing mainly with precise absolute times. Little consideration has been given to imprecise absolute times or infinite absolute times. No consideration has been given to imprecise infinite absolute times either. Many algebraic models are dealing with temporal or value imperfection, with no description of semantics of uncertain information. There is a need for conceptual models that capture the essential semantics of data imperfection, belief, and the temporal nature of imperfect information.

The paper shows how context – organisational and social – can be taken into account during an information system development process. Socio-technical approaches are holistic in nature and provide opportunities to produce information systems utilising social science insights, computer science technical competence and psychological approaches. These approaches provide fact-finding methods that are appropriate to system participants’ and organisational stakeholders’ needs.

A Unifying Framework for Representing Structural and Operational Aspects of Electricity Sector Deregulation,,"Department of Computation, UMIST, Manchester, UK, , , , , , GB",Jul-00,"Recent years have witnessed a worldwide wave of deregulatory reforms in many areas of economic activity. In the electricity sector in particular, a multitude of completed as well as ongoing efforts for deregulation demonstrate the need for the development of a framework that allows a systematic reasoning on the valid alternatives for reform. In this paper we propose a view of the electricity supply industry that combines structural characteristics of the sector with operational ones so as to offer a unified view of deregulation alternatives. This framework allows the description of existing models of reform in a generic and abstract way, offering the ability to examine possible combinations of deregulatory features in a structured and repeatable manner.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660070019,,['Key words:Actor-Role Modelling – Deregulation – Electricity supply industry – Models – Operation – Structure'],2Citations,Springer,,Nikos Prekas,Pericles Loucopoulos,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007660070019,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Formal Analysis of Memory Requirements,,"Department of Computer Science, Loughborough University, UK, , , , , , GB",Dec-99,"Shared memory provides a convenient programming model for parallel applications. However, such a model is provided on physically distributed memory systems at the expense of efficiency of execution of the applications. For this reason, applications can give minimum consistency requirements on the memory system, thus allowing alternatives to the shared memory model to be used which exploit the underlying machine more efficiently. To be effective, these requirements need to be specified in a precise way and to be amenable to formal analysis. Most approaches to formally specifying consistency conditions on memory systems have been from the viewpoint of the machine rather than from the application domain.
 In this paper we show how requirements on memory systems can be given from the viewpoint of the application domain formally in a first-order theory MemReq, to improve the requirements engineering process for such systems. We show the general use of MemReq in expressing major classes of requirements for memory systems and conduct a case study of the use of MemReq in a real-life parallel system out of which the formalism arose.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660050019,,['Key words:Memory systems – Parallel applications – Predicate calculus'],1Citation,Springer,,Walter Hussak,John A.

A Multi-Model View of Process Modelling,,"Université de Paris 1 Sorbonne, Centre de Recherche en Informatique, Paris, France, , , , , , FR",Dec-99,"Situatedness of development processes is a key issue in both the software engineering and the method engineering communities, as there is a strong felt need for process prescriptions to be adapted to the situation at hand. The assumption of the process modelling approach presented in this paper is that process prescriptions should be selected according to the actual situation at hand, i.e. dynamically in the course of the process. The paper focuses on a multi-model view of process modelling which supports this dynamicity. The approach builds on the notion of a labelled graph of intentions and strategies called a map as well as its associated guidelines. The map is a navigational structure which supports the dynamic selection of the intention to be achieved next and the appropriate strategy to achieve it, whereas guidelines help in the operationalisation of the selected intention. The paper presents the map and guidelines and exemplifies the approach using the CREWS-L’Ecritoire method for requirements engineering.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660050018,,['Key words:Method engineering – Process enactment mechanism – Process guidance – System development process modelling'],198Citations,Springer,,C.

The detailed analysis is carried out by using a (critical) philosophical approach to develop an interpretation of (some key aspects of) requirements engineering practice in actual information systems development situations, utilising a number of practical requirements engineering studies. This analysis is built upon to explain the relationship between requirements engineering, SSM and workforce empowerment. It is concluded that, by maintaining critically focused attention on the economic context, it is theoretically possible to engineer requirements for information systems that would actually empower the workforce. However, the likelihood of using SSM successfully for this purpose is low, as the economic context in which requirements engineering takes place is largely ignored by the SSM advocates.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660050015,,['Key words:Critical theory – Empowerment – Methodology – Soft systems methodology'],3Citations,Springer,,S.

Attempts within existing software development paradigms to cope with business change are identified and discussed, and their problems concerning business change are highlighted. The alternative spiral of change model of tailorable information systems is proposed for thinking about establishing changing and ongoing information systems requirements. It is also proposed that information should be reconceptualised as tailorable. Such a reconceptualisation would allow us to explore ways of establishing information systems requirements that cope with business change.

Engineering Requirements Through Use Cases in Complex Business Environment,,"Business School, South Bank University, London, , , , , , GB",Jul-99,"The increasingly global nature of financial markets and institutions means that the collection and management of information on which decisions might be based are increasingly complex. There is a growing requirement for the integration of information flows at individual and departmental levels, and across processes and organisational boundaries. Effective information management is an important contributory factor in the efficiency of such institutions, though there are many associated problems that do not have obvious or simple answers. This paper discusses the problem of information gathering in complex business environments and considers how use cases can help to alleviate the problem using an example of a multinational organisation. Such organisations often require information systems that can support regional differences. However, management requires consistent and uniform representation of information. The example shows that use cases can be a helpful mechanism for capturing user requirements that accommodate both regional properties as well as their organisational commonalties.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660050013,,['Key words:Global organisations – Object technology – Requirements – Use cases'],5Citations,Springer,,R.

The Importance of Context in Information System Design: An Assessment of Participatory Design,,"Department of Information Systems and Computing, Brunel University, Uxbridge, UK, , , , , , GB",Jul-99,"This paper is predicated on requirements analysis as the Achilles heel of information systems development, and accepts that information systems often disappoint. Most design paradigms can be located within a rationalistic framework polarised by requirements analysis and system delivery. Such traditional design paradigms are seen as palliatives that prevent us moving toward more satisfying information systems. It is argued that this rationalistic framework forces us to identify, and attempt to solve, problems that are symptomatic of the approach adopted. A pluralistic framework for information system development is presented which rejects the notions of requirements analysis and system optimality. Participatory design, derived from the field of human computer interaction, is located within this framework and identified as a possible paradigm for information system development. A case study is conducted to assess the benefits of participatory design techniques and to evaluate the extent to which participatory design can overcome the failings of traditional methodologies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660050017,,['Key words:Industrial democracy – Participatory design – Systems development – Work organisation'],21Citations,Springer,,C.

Seven-Layer Model of the Role of the Facilitator in Requirements Engineering,,"Department of Computation, UMIST, Manchester, UK, GB",17-Feb-14,"There is an increasing understanding of requirements engineering as a group activity. Those who have participated in requirements workshops and meetings will recognise that success often depends on the mediation skills of the workshop facilitator.
The role of the facilitator in requirements engineering was the subject of a lively debate at the International Conference on Requirements Engineering (ICRE’98) where a panel of professional facilitators
1
 shared their experiences with participants.

The aim of this paper is to present a full discussion of the role of the facilitator in requirements engineering. The paper is important for the following reasons:

1. The role of the facilitator in the success of requirements workshops is often grossly underestimated (if a workshop was successful, the role of the facilitator is often forgotten).

2. The requirements engineering community should develop a better understanding of the role of the facilitator in addressing the twin concerns of successfully involving people in the requirements process and of producing good-quality requirements specifications within the resources available.

3. Electronic meeting systems are increasingly being used not only in face-to-face meetings but also in meetings where participants are geographically dispersed. Detailed descriptions of the role of the facilitator will provide a blueprint for developing appropriate computer support for facilitation which may well be vital to the success of distributed requirements engineering teams.

The paper discusses the importance of conflict in requirements teams and the role of the facilitator in dealing with conflict. A number of facilitated requirements methods are reviewed and a number of models of facilitation described. The paper then presents summaries of six case studies of situations where the author has acted as a professional facilitator of commercial requirements engineering teams. The lessons learned from these experiences are brought together with existing facilitation models to produce a new model. The main outcome of the research presented in this paper is a seven-layer model of the role of the facilitator.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660050009,,['Key words: CSCW; Distributed teamwork; Facilitation; Facilitator; Groupware; Requirements capture'],11Citations,Springer,,Linda A.

A Methodology for Constructing User-Oriented Requirements Specifications for Large-Scale Systems Using Electronic Hypermedia,,"Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, US",17-Feb-14,"Abstractrequirements specifications are developed for large-scale systems, the final specification is usually an abstraction of the original requirements data into a text-based form that is often foreign to end-users. A method was developed for representing requirements through use of electronic multimedia. The resulting specification is capable of representing requirements and requirements data in a manner that is more representative of the real-world problem space than traditional specifications. This paper presents a method for incorporating multimedia exhibits, notably the results of rapid prototyping activities and animated simulation, into a requirements specification for large-scale C2I systems. To examine the effectiveness of the method, a multimedia requirements specification was developed based on an existing text specification for a real-world system.

Behavioural Views for Software Requirements Engineering,,"Computing and Information Science, Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, CA",17-Feb-14,"AbstractThis paper introduces the idea of a software behavioural view: intuitively, this is a complete description of the behaviour of the system observable from a specific point of view. We believe that a fully developed methodology based on views would significantly reduce the complexity of creating and understanding software requirements. In this paper we take the first steps towards such a methodology. We define a formal notation, Viewcharts, with a well-defined semantics based on Statecharts. Viewcharts gives a means for precisely describing views and their compositions. We show that Viewcharts reasonably capture the informal idea of a view by giving an example: a manufacturing control system. We show that Viewcharts have some advantages over Statecharts; in particular, Viewcharts add name space control to limit the scope of broadcast communication, solving a problem with Statecharts presented by Harel.",https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00013710,,"['Formal methods', 'Specification languages', 'Statecharts', 'Visual languages']",7Citations,Springer,,A.

In the paper ‘Managing standards compliance’ [http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/w.emmerich/publications/TSE/stdscompl.html] we identify this problem and describe a support environment to provide identification and correction of non-compliance to standards.

Engineering as a co-operative inquiry: A framework,,"Independent Consultant, London, UK",Jun-98,"AbstractThis paper has grown out of my specific dissatisfaction with a view of the world centred on technology, rather than on the people who will use that technology. I have therefore looked for a framework which makes a definite shift of focus towards users, but allowing existing techniques wherever these are helpful. The paper presents a new framework in which requirements engineering is treated as a co-operative inquiry (C1), a general method for reaching shared understanding within a group. The treatment leads to a division of the requirements engineering life cycle into four cycles of co-operation between users and developers. With each cycle, a model (which may be quite conventional) is developed. The approach is compared with existing methods, and some predictions are made about how it may perform.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02919973,,"['Co-operative inquiry', 'Facilitation', 'Inquiry cycle', 'Negotiation', 'Requirements engineering', 'User participation']",8Citations,Springer,,Ian Alexander,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02919973,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
A harmonised model for safety assessment and certification of safety-critical systems in the transportation industries,,"Department of Computer Science, University of York, YO10 5DD, York, UK",Jun-98,"AbstractThis paper describes a model for the assessment and certification of safety-critical programmable electronic systems in the transportation industries. The proposed model is founded on the significant commonalities between emerging international safety-related standards in the automotive, railway and aerospace industries. It contains a system development and a safety assessment process which rationalise and unify the common requirements among the standards in these areas. In addition, it defines an evolutionary process for the development of the system’s safety case. The safety case process shows how the evidence produced in the progression of safety assessment can be structured in order to form an overall argument about the safety of the system. We conclude that it is possible to use this model as the basis of a generic approach to the certification of systems across the transportation sector.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02919975,,"['Certification requirements', 'IEC-61508', 'Safety assessment', 'Safety cases', 'Safety process', 'Safety standards']",2Citations,Springer,,Yiannis Papadopoulos,John A.

A proposal for a scenario classification framework,,"University of Paris, 1-Sorbonne, 17 rue de la Sorbonne, 75231, Paris Cedex 05, France",Mar-98,"AbstractThe requirements engineering, information systems and software engineering communities recently advocated scenario-based approaches which emphasise the user/system interaction perspective in developing computer systems. Use of examples, scenes, narrative descriptions of contexts, mock-ups and prototypes-all these ideas can be called scenario-based approaches, although exact definitions are not easy beyond stating that these approaches emphasise some description of the real world. Experience seems to tell us that people react to ‘real things’ and that this helps in clarifying requirements. Indeed, the widespread acceptance of prototyping in system development points to the effectiveness of scenario-based approaches. However, we have little understanding about how scenarios should be constructed, little hard evidence about their effectiveness and even less idea about why they work.The paper is an attempt to explore some of the issues underlying scenario-based approaches in requirements engineering and to propose a framework for their classification. The framework is a four-dimensional framework which advocates that a scenario-based approach can be well defined by itsform, content, purpose andlife cycle. Every dimension is itself multifaceted and a metric is associated with each facet. Motivations for developing the framework are threefold: (a) to help in understanding and clarifying existing scenario-based approaches; (b) to situate the industrial practice of scenarios; and (c) to assist researchers develop more innovative scenario-based approaches.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02802919,,"['Requirement Engineering', 'Scenario Approach', 'Context Facet', 'Instance Scenario', 'Task Scenario']",136Citations,Springer,,C.

The method uses two types of scenario: structure models of the system context and scripts of system usage. A modelling language is reported for describing scenarios, and heuristics are given to cross-check dependencies between scenario models and the requirements specification. Heuristics are grouped into several analytic treatments that investigate correspondences between users’ goals and system functions; input events and system processes to deal with them; system output and its destination in the scenario model, and acceptability analysis of system output for different stakeholders. The method is illustrated with a case study taken from the London Ambulance Service report.

Designing with scenarios: A critical review of current research and practice,,"Datel Advanced Systems Ltd, Datel House, Caspian Road, Atlantic Street, WA14 5HH, Altrincham, UK",Mar-98,"AbstractThere is a great deal of requirements engineering specifically, and information systems development research in general, in the area of scenarios as the ‘vocabulary’ for discussing and characterising designs for new artefacts. This is partly due to opening up the design process to a variety of participants in a project, and making explicit their ways of working, thinking and interactions with the design products. Scenarios, being concrete, and easy to understand and use, provide the means to describe the design vocabulary. They are used to focus on episodic cases, exchange ideas and thoughts about them effectively, and generally describe requirements and designs for a new artefact from the user’s perspective. In this paper, we review the effectiveness of the current state-of-practice in scenario-based approaches.

Scenario Development and Practical Decision Making under Uncertainty: Application to Requirements Engineering,,"University of Paris, Paris, France, , , , , , FR",Mar-98,"In this paper, we address the question of how flesh and blood decision makers manage the combinatorial explosion in scenario development for decision making under uncertainty. The first assumption is that the decision makers try to undertake ‘robust’ actions. For the decision maker a robust action is an action that has sufficiently good results whatever the events are. We examine the psychological as well as the theoretical problems raised by the notion of robustness. Finally, we address the false feeling of decision makers who talk of ‘risk control’. We argue that ‘risk control’ results from the thinking that one can postpone action after nature moves. This ‘action postponement’ amounts to changing look-ahead reasoning into diagnosis. We illustrate these ideas in the framework of software development and examine some possible implications for requirements analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660050003,,['Key words:Decision practice – Requirements analysis – Risk control – Scenario development'],6Citations,Springer,,Jean-Charles Pomerol,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007660050003,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Scenario-Based Techniques for Supporting the Elaboration and the Validation of Formal Requirements,,"Institut d’Informatique, University of Namur;, , , , , , BE",Mar-98,"Developing complex, safety critical systems requires precise, unambiguous specification of requirements. A formal specification language is thus well suited to this task. Formal specification languages require, but also exacerbate, the need for tools. In particular, tools should support the elaboration (how to build the formal specification) and the validation (how to check the adequacy of the specification towards the informal needs of the various stakeholders). This paper focuses on the language Albert II, a formal language designed for the purpose of expressing requirements for distributed real-time systems. It presents two contributions supporting its use. The first contribution aims at improving the elaboration process by providing a method for constructing an Albert II description from scenarios expressing the stakeholders’ requirements. These are represented through message sequence charts extended to deal with composite systems. The second contribution takes the form of a requirements validation tool (a so-called animator) that the stakeholders can use interactively and cooperatively in order to explore different possible behaviours (or instance-level scenarios) of the future system. These behaviours are automatically checked against the formal requirements specification.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660050005,,['Key words:Animation – Formal methods – Message sequence charts – Scenarios'],30Citations,Springer,,Patrick Heymans,Eric Dubois,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007660050005,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Scenario-Based Analysis of COTS Acquisition Impacts,,"GTE Laboratories Incorporated, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA, , , , , , US",Mar-98,"When an enterprise considers the acquisition of a COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) system, the procurement process typically includes consideration of technical criteria such as feature sets and ease of integration with other systems. However, any selected COTS system will also have an impact on how the enterprise runs – how the work of the enterprise gets done and ultimately how the services of the enterprise are delivered to its customers. This paper presents a method for determining these enterprise-level impacts. A notion of enterprise-level impacts is delineated, and a scenario-based technique is presented for uncovering and assessing these impacts. The method is informal and lightweight – it does not require extensive modelling, formal rigour, or management of artefacts. Some insights, experience and lessons are reported. Some comparisons are made with past experience using a more formal, heavyweight method and tool.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660050004,,['Key words:COTS acquisition – Enterprise-level impacts – Scenarios – System procurement'],15Citations,Springer,,M.

A Representational Framework for Scenarios of System Use,,"College of Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina;, , , , , , US",Mar-98,"Scenarios are becoming widely used in three areas of system development: software engineering, human–computer interaction (HCI), and organisational process design. There are many reasons to use scenarios during system design. The one usually advanced in support of the practice is to aid the processes of validating the developers’ understanding of the customers’ or users’ work practices, organisational goals and structures, and system requirements. All three areas identified above deal with these processes, and not surprisingly this has given rise to a profusion of scenario-based practices and representations. Yet there has been little analysis of why scenarios should be useful, let alone whether they are. Only by having such a framework for understanding what scenarios are, and what they are for, can we begin to evaluate different scenario approaches in specific development contexts. This paper is a contribution toward such a framework. We lay out a space of representational possibilities for scenarios and enumerate a set of values or criteria that are important for different uses of scenarios. We then summarise several salient representations drawn from the software engineering, HCI, and organisational process design communities to clarify how these representational choices contribute to or detract from the goals of the respective practices. Finally, we discuss how scenario representations from one area of design may be useful in others, and we discuss the relationship between these representations and other significant early-design and requirements engineering practices.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007660050006,,['Key words:Design representations – Requirements engineering – Scenarios'],20Citations,Springer,,Annie I.

Constructing and revising formal arguments in requirements engineering,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Durham, UK",Dec-97,"AbstractConfidence that a proposed software-based system, once implemented, will be successful in its environment can be given through a formal argument, typically proof in a formal language. Problems with such arguments include the need to account for the relationships between different kinds of model (models of the proposed system, of assumptions concerning its environment, and of the joint properties, or requirements, which the system should achieve with its environment), and the need to revise these models within an exploratory requirements engineering process. This paper investigates the assumption/commitment style of modelling, originally developed for reasoning about interference in concurrent systems, for developing such arguments. The style, using a simple temporal logic, is used to express these models, with an associated compositional reasoning method allowing arguments to be constructed, and revised with minimal re-work of proof. Some conclusions are drawn concerning the benefits of, and problems with, this approach.

The process meta-model acts as a shell for defining process models by instantiation. An enactment mechanism implemented in a tool environment has been defined. It allows execution of process models and provides effective guidance to the requirements engineer. Construction of process models is also supported based on generic method knowledge chunks.

The performance of the N-fold requirement inspection method,,"Computer Science Dept., Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, 32000, Haifa, Israel",Sep-97,"AbstractFaults in system requirements can be very harmful. It is therefore often required that the inspection achieves a high fault detection ratio (FDR). To achieve this, a large number of inspectors is required. Large teams are known to be inefficient. Therefore, the N-fold requirements inspection method divides the inspectors intoN small efficient teams. All temas inspect the same requirements document. Experiments with both information and real-time systems demonstrate that the different teams detect different faults such that they achieve together a higher FDR value. The analysis suggests that the FDR is primarily a function of the level of expertise of the inspectors and of the number of teams. A quite simple probabilistic model that matches the experimental results enables the prediction of the FDR as a function of these two parameters. A diagram based on the model enables a fast estimation of the FDR and of the most effective number of inspections teams money-wise. The model may also be employed for measuring the efficiency of requirement inspection methods.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02802773,,"['Fault detection ratio', 'Inspection', 'n fold inspection', 'Probabilistic model', 'Requirements']",9Citations,Springer,,E.

Ten steps towards systematic requirements reuse,,"Rolls-Royce University Technology Centre, Department of Computer Science, The University of York, York, UK",Jun-97,"AbstractReusability is widely suggested to be a key to improving software development productivity and quality [1,2]. It has been further argued that reuse at the requirements level can significantly increase reuse at the later stages of development [3,4]. However, there is little evidence in the literature to suggest that requirements reuse is widely practised. This paper describes ten practical steps towards systematic requirements reuse based on work at the Rolls-Royce Systems and Software University Technology Centre (UTC) for Rolls-Smiths Engine Controls Ltd (RoSEC) in the domain of aero-engine control systems. We believe these steps have made a significant overall contribution to the 50% reuse figure quoted by the management at RoSEC for current projects within the BR700 family of engine controllers.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02813029,,"['Aero-engines', 'Case study', 'Practical', 'Requirements', 'Reuse']",43Citations,Springer,,W.

Telecommunications service requirements: Principles for managing complexity,,"AT&T Laboratories-Research, London, UK",Jun-97,"AbstractTelecommunications services are complex and rapidly becoming more so. If we wish to apply formal methods of requirements engineering in the telecommunications domain, then the primary obstacle we face is the sheer complexity of the behaviour to be described. This paper focuses on one kind of telecommunications system, thelong-distance telephone network (LDTN), and presents several ways of managing complexity in LDTN requirements. The alleviation of complexity comes from careful application of some general principles of requirements engineering.

The relationship between SISTeM© and requirements engineering is discussed and future developments considered.The main bulk of the paper is a description of the use of SISTeM© in supporting the Programme Management Board of the NHS Executive aimed at a shared appreciation of what constitutes an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) within an acute hospital. This was used by the EPR Programme Board and Director as a basis for the negotiation of the project initiation document agreed with sites and their IS contractors. The designs that emerged have been used elsewhere in evaluating the programme and underpinning strategies within the health service.

This article improves an existing cost-value approach in which stakeholders compare all unique pairs of candidate requirements according to their value and their cost of implementation. Techniques for reducing the required number of comparisons are suggested, thus making the process more efficient. An initial approach for managing requirements interdependencies is proposed. A support tool for the improved process has been developed to make the process more practical in commercial developments.

Towards a formal definition of methods,,"Division of Computer Engineering, Delhi Institute of Technology, 110006, Delhi, India",Mar-97,"AbstractThe absence of a formal specification of methods permits application engineers to interpret method concepts in any way they want. Further, different CASE tool designers can implement the same method concepts in different ways. The approach to formal method specification described here is in three levels: the generic level, the method independent level, and the method level. The generic level provides a model of a method which can be instantiated to yield a method-independent view of methods. This view can, in turn, be instantiated to yield the formal method of interest. The attempt is to represent methods independently of any underlying way-of-working or paradigm, remove the process/product dichtomy by tight coupling of the process and product aspects of methods, and permit extensibility of methods. The formal specification can be used as a basis for building CASE tools, as an output to be produced by a CAME tool, and for defining development processes.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02802896,,"['CASE', 'CAME', 'Context', 'Decision', 'Metamodel', 'Method', 'Method engineering', 'Method fragment']",16Citations,Springer,,Naveen Prakash,,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02802896,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Expressing requirements on a parallel system formally,,"Department of Computer Studies, Loughborough University, LE11 3T, Loughborough, UK",Dec-96,AbstractWe examine the nature of requirements on parallel total systems and the problem of documenting those requirements formally. The choice of the formal description method to be used should take into account the nature of the system to be developed and the benefits that method will bring to the provision of requirements in that particular project.We present our discussion through a case study of a formal description of an industrial-scale parallel system. Various project criteria for the formal documentation of requirements yield a method of formal description where the semantics of the language representing the system is given by first specifying the semantics of a quotient language and then extending to the original language by equational reasoning. We formulate the general method and indicate which types of project might adopt a similar approach.,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01587100,,"['Parallel systems', 'Requirements', 'Formal description', 'Equational reasoning']",2Citations,Springer,,W.

Dealing with change: An approach using non-functional requirements,,"Computer Science Program, University of Texas at Dallas, PO Box 830688, 75083-0688, Richardson, Texas, USA",Dec-96,"AbstractNon-functional requirements (or quality requirements, NFRs) such as confidentiality, performance and timeliness are often crucial to a software system. Concerns for such NFRs are often the impetus for change. To systematically support system evolution, this paper adapts the ‘NFR Framework’, which treats NFRs as goals to be achieved during development. Throughout the process, consideration of design alternatives, analysis of trade-offs and rationalisation of design decisions are all carried out in relation to the stated goals, and captured in historical records. We show how such historical records of treating NFRs as goals also system-atically support system evolution. This approach is illustrated by a study of changes in loan policies at Barclays Bank. The study considered changes in NFRs, and associated changes in priorities, workload and functionality. The study's historical records helped quickly determine the impact of changes. We also present guidelines for consistently managing historical records, and address tool support for the change process.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01587102,,"['Support System', 'System Evolution', 'Software Engineer', 'Historical Record', 'Change Process']",34Citations,Springer,,Lawrence Chung,Brian A.

Utilizing deontic operators in information systems specification,,"Andersen Consulting, Skoyen, Box 228, N-0212, Oslo, Norway",Dec-96,"AbstractOne major task in requirements specification is to capture the rules relevant to the problem at hand. Declarative, rule-based approaches have been suggested by many researchers in the field. However, when it comes to modeling large systems of rules, not only for the behavior of the computer system but also for the organizational environment surrounding it, current approaches have problems with limited expressiveness, flexibility, and poor comprehensibility. Hence, rule-based approaches may benefit from improvements in two directions: (1) improvement of the rule languages themselves and (2) better integration with other, complementary modeling approaches.In this article, both issues are addressed in an integrated manner. The proposal is presented in the context of the Tempora project on rule-based information systems development, but has also been integrated with PPP. Tempora has provided a rule language based on an executable temporal logic working on top of a temporal database. The rule language is integrated with static (ER-like) and dynamic (SA/RT-like) modeling approaches. In the current proposal, the integration with complementary modeling approaches is extended by including organization modeling (actors, roles), and the expressiveness of the rule language is increased by introducing deontic operators and rule hierarchies. The main contribution of the article is not seen as any one of the above-mentioned extensions, but as the resulting comprehensive modeling support. The approach is illustrated by examples taken from an industrial case study done in connection with Tempora.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01587101,,"['Requirements specification', 'Rule modeling', 'Goal modeling', 'Deontic operators']",13Citations,Springer,,John Krogstie,Guttorm Sindre,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01587101,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,

Stakeholder viewpoints in requirements definition: A framework for understanding viewpoint development approaches,,"Department of Information Systems, Monash University, Caulfield East, PO Box 197, 3145, Melboume, Australia",Jun-96,"AbstractRequirements definition is a critical activity within information systems development. It involves many stakeholder groups: managers, various end-users and different systems development professionals. Each group is likely to have its own ‘viewpoint’ representing a particular perspective or set of perceptions of the problem domain. To ensure as far as possible that the system to be implemented meets the needs and expectations of all involved stakeholders, it is necessary to understand their various viewpoints and manage any inconsistencies and conflicts. Viewpoint development during requirements definition is the process of identifying, understanding and representing different viewpoints.

Formal analysis of the Shlaer-Mellor method: Towards a toolkit of formal and informal requirements specification techniques,,"Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Free University, DeBoelelaan 1081a, 1011 IV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jun-96,"AbstractIn this paper, we define a number of tools that we think belong to the core of any toolkit for requirements engineers. The tools are conceptual and hence, they need precise definitions that lay down as exactly as possible what their meaning and possible use is. We argue that this definition can best be achieved by a formal specification of the tool. This means that for each semi-formal requirements engineering tool we should provide a formal specification that precisely specifies its meaning. We argue that this mutually enhances the formal and semi-formal technique: it makes formal techniques more usable and, as we will argue, at the same time simplifies the diagram-based notations.At the same time, we believe that the tools of the requirements engineer should, where possible, resemble the familiar semi-formal specification techniques used in practice today. In order to achieve this, we should search existing requirements specification techniques to look for a common kernel of familiar semi-formal techniques and try to provide a formalisation for these.In this paper we illustrate this approach by a formal analysis of the Shlaer-Mellor method for object-oriented requirements specification. The formal specification language used in this analysis is LCM, a language based on dynamic logic, but similar results would have been achieved by means of another language. We analyse the techniques used in the information model, state model, process model and communication model of the Shlaer-Mellor method, identify ambiguities and redundancies, indicate how these can be eliminated and propose a formalisation of the result. We conclude with a listing of the tools extracted from the Shlaer-Mellor method that we can add to a toolkit that in addition contains LCM as formal specification technique.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01235905,,"['Requirements specification', 'Object-oriented analysis', 'Formal specification', 'Dynamic logic']",7Citations,Springer,,R.

It covers many of the commonly used modes of causal language including necessary and sufficient cause, prevention and enabling conditions. The concept of condition splitting is introduced, enabling a specification at an abstract level to treat two conditions as identical, while a concrete refinement of it may view them as separate. A number of other issues are examined, including: repetitive, probabilistic and hidden causes; causal agents; the validation of causal descriptions; and concurrency.

In this paper we develop a theoretical model which predicts that the interaction between user participation in the RE process and uncertainty has an impact on RE success. This theory is empirically tested using survey data. We develop instruments to measure user participation and uncertainty. An existing instrument for measuring RE success was used. This instrument covers two dimensions of RE success: (a) the quality of RE service, and (b) the quality of RE products. The results, indicate that as uncertainty increases, greater user participation alleviates the negative influence of uncertainty on the quality of RE service, and that as uncertainty decreases, the beneficial effects on the quality of RE service of increasing user participation diminish. Furthermore, we did not find that the interaction between user participation and uncertainty had an impact on the quality of RE products. Based on these results, we make recommendations for managing user participation in the RE process, and provide directions for future research.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01235763,,"['User participation', 'Contingency theory', 'Empirieal study', 'Uncertainty', 'Requirements engineering success']",46Citations,Springer,,Khaled El Emam,Soizic Quintin,Nazim H.

GRLMerger: an automatic approach for integrating GRL models,,"Information and Computer Science Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, PO.Box 1621, 31261, Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia",04-Mar-24,"AbstractGoal-oriented requirements engineering aims to describe both stakeholders and system goals and their relationships using goal models. Large goal models for complex systems are often constructed from sub-models describing various stakeholders’ views and context-related aspects. These goal-oriented sub-models, also called views, may exhibit overlaps and present discrepancies. Hence, integrating such views is considered a significant barrier to the construction of a unified goal model. Current approaches to merging goal models require intensive human intervention. This paper proposes an approach and a prototype tool, called GRLMerger, to integrate two GRL (Goal-oriented Requirement Language) models into one consolidated model that is correct, complete, and free from any conflict that may arise during the merging process. GRLMerger considers both syntactic and semantic aspects of the GRL models and allows analysts to merge them either interactively or in a fully automated mode. GRLMerger employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to match intentional elements based on their semantic similarity. The proposed GRLMerger approach and tool have been validated using 12 experimental tasks derived from two case studies, exhibiting very promising performance.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-024-00413-6,,"['Goal-oriented modeling', 'Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL)', 'Integration', 'Matching', 'Merging', 'Semantics', 'Natural language processing']",,Springer,,Nadeen AlAmoudi,Jameleddine Hassine,Malak Baslyman,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-024-00413-6,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Advances in automated support for requirements engineering: a systematic literature review,,"Department of Informatics, King’s College London, Strand, London, WC2R 2LS, UK",03-Feb-24,"AbstractRequirements Engineering (RE) has undergone several transitions over the years, from traditional methods to agile approaches emphasising increased automation. In many software development projects, requirements are expressed in natural language and embedded within large volumes of text documents. At the same time, RE activities aim to define software systems' functionalities and constraints. However, manually executing these tasks is time-consuming and prone to errors. Numerous research efforts have proposed tools and technologies for automating RE activities to address this challenge, which are documented in published works. This review aims to examine empirical evidence on automated RE and analyse its impact on the RE sub-domain and software development. To achieve our goal, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) following established guidelines for conducting SLRs. We aimed to identify, aggregate, and analyse papers on automated RE published between 1996 and 2022. We outlined the output of the support tool, the RE phase covered, levels of automation, development approach, and evaluation approaches. We identified 85 papers that discussed automated RE from various perspectives and methodologies. The results of this review demonstrate the significance of automated RE for the software development community, which has the potential to shorten development cycles and reduce associated costs. The support tools primarily assist in generating UML models (44.7%) and other activities such as omission of steps, consistency checking, and requirement validation. The analysis phase of RE is the most widely automated phase, with 49.53% of automated tools developed for this purpose. Natural language processing technologies, particularly POS tagging and Parser, are widely employed in developing these support tools. Controlled experimental methods are the most frequently used (48.2%) for evaluating automated RE tools, while user studies are the least employed evaluation method (8.2%). This paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing an updated overview of the research literature, enabling a better understanding of trends and state-of-the-art practices in automated RE for researchers and practitioners. It also paves the way for future research directions in automated requirements engineering.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-023-00411-0,available,"['Requirements engineering', 'Automated RE', 'Automation', 'Support', 'Systematic literature review']",,Springer,,Muhammad Aminu Umar,Kevin Lano,,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-023-00411-0,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
Understanding the integration of accessibility requirements in the development process of information systems: a systematic literature review,,"Department of Economics, Management, Industrial Engineering and Tourism (DEGEIT), University of Aveiro, Campus Universitário de Santiago, 3810-193, Aveiro, Portugal",27-Jan-24,"AbstractPeople with disabilities (PwD) are frequently excluded from certain activities due to the lack of accessible information. In this area, information systems can help PwD by allowing access to a range of information about the accessibility of spaces, facilities, and products. There has been an increase in technologies that promote accessibility, but there are few literature studies which analyse how these technologies were developed to ensure access for all. To address this gap, this study aims to explore the integration of accessibility requirements in the processes of developing information systems. To achieve this aim, a systematic literature review was conducted using the PRISMA reporting guidelines. To conduct the review, a search was carried out for primary studies in four well-established databases—SCOPUS, Web of Science, IEEE, and ACM. A snowball search to find additional studies was also performed. Based on this, 34 papers were obtained to conduct the study. In general, the studies published on this topic are relatively recent, with healthcare and education being the two major areas where accessibility in information systems is most addressed. The integration of accessibility seems to be primarily applied during the requirement assessment and testing phases, involving potential users in the process. The results obtained within this systematic literature review raise awareness about the integration of accessibility for the success of solutions, which are oriented towards the accessible market. Additionally, the different practical and theoretical contributions can help future practitioners and technology developers establish guidelines that promote the integration of accessibility, thus achieving a more accessible and inclusive society.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-023-00409-8,available,"['Accessibility', 'Information systems', 'People with disabilities (PwD)', 'Development process', 'Systematic literature review']",,Springer,,Pedro Teixeira,Celeste Eusébio,Leonor Teixeira,,,,,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-023-00409-8,Requirements Engineering,,,,,,,
